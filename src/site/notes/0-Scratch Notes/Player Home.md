# DM Note
Hey everyone,  thanks for going on this adventure with me. This isn't something I ever really intended to do, but I want to play 20 characters not just one, so it is what it is. I hope you enjoy inhabiting this world as much as I have enjoyed building it.

Although the world is relatively fleshed out, there is still a lot to do so if it takes time to address your sub plots, I apologize, but I hope we'll have a lot of time to get to it.

See you soon, good to see you, or why are you reading this now? (depending on when you get to it)
Nico
