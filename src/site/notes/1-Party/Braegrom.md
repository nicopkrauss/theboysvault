| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | The session begins immediately after a dwarf, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]], jumps into lava. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] expresses confusion and asks if anyone caught the dwarf's name, only knowing him as "the small dwarf." [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] comments on the small racist dwarf. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then turns his attention to the immediate threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], being invisible, moves towards a red-marked cultist and uses Green Flame Blade, hitting with advantage for 6 damage. The flame then bounces to a green-marked cultist for 3 damage (her charisma modifier). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] then commands her pseudo-dragon to dive into the lava to retrieve the relic [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] lost. The dragon immediately combusts and dies. Several cultists are noted as dead, including the one affected by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam. One cultist attempts to cast Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], who succeeds on his Wisdom saving throw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves, avoiding lava and Moonbeam, but misses [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with an attack. He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast at [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], hitting for 6 damage (including Hex damage). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes Moonbeam damage. He then channels the artifacts, attempting to pull everyone in. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] succeed on their Strength checks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is now prone with his head in the lava. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | A lengthy logic puzzle ensued. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] led the deduction, analyzing the statements for contradictions based on the note's rules: one statue tells only truth, one tells only lies. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] initially guessed Statue 1 held the key. After much debate and logical walkthroughs, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] concluded the key should be in Statue 1, based on the assumption that Statue 2 was the truth-teller. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pulled the sword from Statue 1, but it snapped back, the statue's eyes glowed red, and he took 6 psychic damage. However, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] pointed out a potential flaw in the puzzle's design, suggesting two logical solutions might exist. The DM conceded a possible error. Retconning the damage, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully pulled the pommel off Statue 1's sword, revealing the key. Out of curiosity (and perhaps exploiting the puzzle break), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] tried Statue 2 and found a second, flimsier key made of a strange, shifting material. The first key perfectly fit the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The doorway revealed the familiar forest clearing where they first fought the Ashforge Guardian near the dungeon entrance – a portal exit. The party emerged back into the mountain pass around 2 PM. On their way back towards Tavirsk, they encountered the exact same setup as their first goblin ambush: a sword stuck in a tree. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] spoke to the tree, which confirmed goblins (_Correction: Bandits_) were hiding nearby. The party confronted the bandits, led by a captain furious about what happened to his cousin "Fred" (_Correction: Initially called Brett by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]_) in the previous encounter. Despite attempts at intimidation (including [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threatening to squeeze the captain's throat like he did Fred's), the bandits, revealing they knew about the relics and were sent to retrieve them, attacked. Initiative was rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] went first, recklessly attacking Gulrath and moving to the edge of a lava pool, threatening to destroy the artifacts. Gulrath summoned Shardbinder cultists. One cultist attempted Hold Person on [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] but failed. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] went huge again, used inspiration on a missed attack, and landed two massive hits on Gulrath (70 total damage), grappling and restraining him with runes and gloves (_Correction: Glove grapple effect corrected to once per rest, second grapple/restrain attempt failed_). Another cultist failed Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot at a cultist but missed. The battle lines were drawn as more cultists moved in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a nature temple by splashing water on vine-covered doors. Inside, they found a room with three doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. A plaque above the middle door (Door 2) read "Follow the vowel to exit". [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] detected magical energy from two of the doors, suggesting they were dimensional portals, while one was a true door. After investigating the doors, checking for traps, and examining the plaque (noticing the 'O' in 'Follow' was worn), the party debated which door to choose. The consensus landed on Door 1, as 'One' starts with a vowel and the worn 'O' hinted at a connection. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

At the door, they found specific indentations: two fist-sized holes in the wall, two foot-shaped prints on the floor riddled with smaller holes, and one larger, head-sized hole in the wall. They deduced these corresponded to the artifacts they carried (Gloves, Boots, Crown). After some debate about whether to place the items or wear them, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] put his gloved hands into the fist slots engaging a timer and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] forcibly shoved [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s crowned head into the head slot, and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s booted feet into the foot slots. The slots tightened, locking them in place momentarily before the trap deactivated and the large door to the library opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a large, well-kept library. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s compass indicated four points of interest. Investigating, they found four relics displayed: two different bows and two different suits of chest armor. They also found three statues (holding a book, a sword, and a shield) and interactive globes. Spinning the globes summoned a curator orb. Through interaction with the orb and finding notes/books (The Rootless Branch, Forged in Fire, Relics of Power, Titans As We Know Them, and several numbered notes), they deciphered clues related to the statues and relics. The statues represented "Defense of Sacred Knowledge" (Book), "Power to Mold the World" (Sword), and "Glory of the Founder" (Shield), which needed to be activated in a specific order by speaking the correct phrase. This revealed hidden rooms containing more notes. The notes contained lore and clues, including dates (interpreted as number codes: 2, 4, 135 for one relic; 23, 3, 37 for the other) linked to the books "The Rootless Branch" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]]) and "Forged in Fire" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]]), which the curator highlighted as favorites. The party deduced these were the two "true" relics among the four displayed. Two pedestals rose in the main room. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] (the red gem armor) and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] (the vine/branch bow) onto the pedestals. This revealed a staircase forward and granted the party the chosen relics.                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | The party resumed their fight against the [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]]. After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
