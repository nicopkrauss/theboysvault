| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a nature temple by splashing water on vine-covered doors. Inside, they found a room with three doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. A plaque above the middle door (Door 2) read "Follow the vowel to exit". [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] detected magical energy from two of the doors, suggesting they were dimensional portals, while one was a true door. After investigating the doors, checking for traps, and examining the plaque (noticing the 'O' in 'Follow' was worn), the party debated which door to choose. The consensus landed on Door 1, as 'One' starts with a vowel and the worn 'O' hinted at a connection. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 1 teleported the party into a chamber with a chasm and spike traps, facing two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]]. Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Upon defeating the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], the party was instantly teleported back to the three-door room. They discussed the puzzle again. Deciding it wasn't Door 1, they opted for Door 3, despite [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s reservations. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 3 teleported the party into another combat room, this time facing two suits of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]]. Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party returned to the previous room. After the brief argument about [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opening the wrong door, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] reiterated the logic based on the first vowel's position in "Exit" pointing to Door 1. However, realizing the pattern they followed was 2, 3, 2, 2, the next logical door based on "Exit" (E being the 1st letter) should be Door 1. They opened Door 1, which finally opened correctly, revealing the next area. The DM confirmed the puzzle logic: the position of the _first_ vowel in each word of the phrase indicated the correct door number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Following the compass north from the main chamber led the party to the steps of the final building. At the door, they found specific indentations: two fist-sized holes in the wall, two foot-shaped prints on the floor riddled with smaller holes, and one larger, head-sized hole in the wall. They deduced these corresponded to the artifacts they carried (Gloves, Boots, Crown). After some debate about whether to place the items or wear them, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] put his gloved hands into the fist slots engaging a timer and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] forcibly shoved [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s crowned head into the head slot, and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s booted feet into the foot slots. The slots tightened, locking them in place momentarily before the trap deactivated and the large door to the library opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a large, well-kept library. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s compass indicated four points of interest. Investigating, they found four relics displayed: two different bows and two different suits of chest armor. They also found three statues (holding a book, a sword, and a shield) and interactive globes. Spinning the globes summoned a curator orb. Through interaction with the orb and finding notes/books (The Rootless Branch, Forged in Fire, Relics of Power, Titans As We Know Them, and several numbered notes), they deciphered clues related to the statues and relics. The statues represented "Defense of Sacred Knowledge" (Book), "Power to Mold the World" (Sword), and "Glory of the Founder" (Shield), which needed to be activated in a specific order by speaking the correct phrase. This revealed hidden rooms containing more notes. The notes contained lore and clues, including dates (interpreted as number codes: 2, 4, 135 for one relic; 23, 3, 37 for the other) linked to the books "The Rootless Branch" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]]) and "Forged in Fire" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]]), which the curator highlighted as favorites. The party deduced these were the two "true" relics among the four displayed. Two pedestals rose in the main room. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] (the red gem armor) and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] (the vine/branch bow) onto the pedestals. This revealed a staircase forward and granted the party the chosen relics. |

After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
