| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | The session begins immediately after a dwarf, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]], jumps into lava. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] expresses confusion and asks if anyone caught the dwarf's name, only knowing him as "the small dwarf." [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] comments on the small racist dwarf. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then turns his attention to the immediate threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attacks the large enemy ([[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]), rolling a 23 to hit and dealing 26 damage, plus an additional 9 fire damage from a fire rune, totaling 35 damage after resistances are considered. One of the cultists, described as a "healthist," moves forward. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Flurry Volley, attacking three different targets with disadvantage. He misses [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] but hits an unmarked cultist (8 damage) and an orange-marked cultist (12 damage). [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s companion, Sable (a dog), moves up and bites an unmarked cultist for 10 damage. A red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the cultist casting Hold Person with a short sword, hitting for 12 damage after a Flurry of Blows. A green-marked cultist attacks Sable, dealing 3 damage. The red-marked cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] for 4 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (controlled by the DM) moves his previously cast Moonbeam. After a debate about how Moonbeam movement works, it's decided it can travel, hitting three cultists. One is obliterated, another takes some damage, and the third is virtually unscathed. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle companion then shoots a fireball, eviscerating the remaining cultist from that group. A blue-marked cultist moves to attack Sable but misses. An orange-marked cultist then attacks [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], dealing 6 damage. A cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes him for 7 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], being invisible, moves towards a red-marked cultist and uses Green Flame Blade, hitting with advantage for 6 damage. The flame then bounces to a green-marked cultist for 3 damage (her charisma modifier). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] then commands her pseudo-dragon to dive into the lava to retrieve the relic [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] lost. The dragon immediately combusts and dies. Several cultists are noted as dead, including the one affected by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam. One cultist attempts to cast Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], who succeeds on his Wisdom saving throw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

He then begins channeling the power of the relics, causing the room to shake vigorously. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] and a cultist make Dexterity saving throws to avoid falling into lava. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempts a front flip over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] to a ledge but fails his Acrobatics check (rolling a 6) and falls prone.

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots the blue-marked cultist for 12 damage. Sable attempts to bite the red-marked cultist but misses. The red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] heals himself for 16 HP and then misses an unarmed strike. The green-marked cultist attacks Sable, but [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses his reaction, Lathai's Warning, forcing the cultist to reroll with disadvantage, resulting in a miss. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves his Moonbeam again, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] (4 damage) and three cultists (8 damage each), killing one.

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes 3 fire damage from [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune. He then channels the artifacts, causing the ground to shake and split further, visually represented by the DM adjusting the map. The Moonbeam is clarified to be a 5-foot radius. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] then unleashes a wave of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] succeed on their Dexterity saves. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] fails her initial save but, after a debate about her position on a rock after teleporting, fails an Acrobatics check as well and takes 5 damage. Sable also fails and takes 5 damage. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] makes his Strength save to end [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s fire rune. He then fails his Constitution save against [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam (now with disadvantage from Hex) and takes damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast at [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], hitting for 6 damage (including Hex damage). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes Moonbeam damage. He then channels the artifacts, attempting to pull everyone in. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] succeed on their Strength checks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is now prone with his head in the lava. |

Sable attempts a bite attack but misses due to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s AC. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks with his longsword but misses, then hits with a bonus action unarmed strike for 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves the Moonbeam over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], who passes the save but still takes 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands. He performs a symbol and says, "Tata for now," disappearing in a puff of smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The session ends here, with the party now in the main story, out of the prologue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party, now joined by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] Ashforge who decided guard duty was less exciting than delving deeper, found themselves leaving the library and entering a rectangular chamber. Inside stood three identical kneeling statues, each with a hand on their sword plunged into the ground before them. Dusty plaques lay at their feet. At the far end of the room was a door with a large keyhole. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a skeleton in the corner and found a note stating: "One speaks only truth. One speaks only lies. Only one sword may yield the key." The party then read the plaques: Statue 1 claimed the key was in Statue 3's sword and that Statue 2's plaque told only truths. Statue 2 claimed the key was in Statue 1's sword and that Statue 3's first statement was false. Statue 3 claimed the key was in Statue 2's sword and that Statue 1's second statement was false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | A lengthy logic puzzle ensued. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] led the deduction, analyzing the statements for contradictions based on the note's rules: one statue tells only truth, one tells only lies. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] initially guessed Statue 1 held the key. After much debate and logical walkthroughs, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] concluded the key should be in Statue 1, based on the assumption that Statue 2 was the truth-teller. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pulled the sword from Statue 1, but it snapped back, the statue's eyes glowed red, and he took 6 psychic damage. However, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] pointed out a potential flaw in the puzzle's design, suggesting two logical solutions might exist. The DM conceded a possible error. Retconning the damage, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully pulled the pommel off Statue 1's sword, revealing the key. Out of curiosity (and perhaps exploiting the puzzle break), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] tried Statue 2 and found a second, flimsier key made of a strange, shifting material. The first key perfectly fit the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | Beyond the door lay a well-lit temple room. Cages lined the walls. In the center, atop a large symbol on the floor, floated a cloak. At the back of the room stood a figure in cultist robes, muttering to himself about being stuck there defending the cloak. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (who were wearing cultist robes from a previous encounter) approached cautiously. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to deceive the cultist, claiming the "Council" had sent them to relieve him of his duty. The cultist was confused, having never heard of a council, and seemed to have been there for a very long time. After a failed deception check by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried again, questioning how they could have reached this chamber if not sent by "him." This deception succeeded (aided by an inspiration point). The cultist, convinced and eager to leave but unsure where to go, was directed outside by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. As the cultist departed, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The doorway revealed the familiar forest clearing where they first fought the Ashforge Guardian near the dungeon entrance – a portal exit. The party emerged back into the mountain pass around 2 PM. On their way back towards Tavirsk, they encountered the exact same setup as their first goblin ambush: a sword stuck in a tree. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] spoke to the tree, which confirmed goblins (_Correction: Bandits_) were hiding nearby. The party confronted the bandits, led by a captain furious about what happened to his cousin "Fred" (_Correction: Initially called Brett by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]_) in the previous encounter. Despite attempts at intimidation (including [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threatening to squeeze the captain's throat like he did Fred's), the bandits, revealing they knew about the relics and were sent to retrieve them, attacked. Initiative was rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] opened with his Flurry Volley, killing one bandit archer and wounding another. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] went first, recklessly attacking Gulrath and moving to the edge of a lava pool, threatening to destroy the artifacts. Gulrath summoned Shardbinder cultists. One cultist attempted Hold Person on [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] but failed. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] went huge again, used inspiration on a missed attack, and landed two massive hits on Gulrath (70 total damage), grappling and restraining him with runes and gloves (_Correction: Glove grapple effect corrected to once per rest, second grapple/restrain attempt failed_). Another cultist failed Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot at a cultist but missed. The battle lines were drawn as more cultists moved in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | The party resumed their fight against the [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]]. After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | After the colossus fight, the party explored the immediate area, finding skeletons yielding a health potion and gold coins taken by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises. They took a long rest, leveled up to 3, and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] gave [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] he found to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. Following a magical compass, they arrived at the entrance to the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], an ancient temple fortress overtaken by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], identified through a successful History check on their shattered heart symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | Inside the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], the party encountered a bridge over lava with pressure plates. They deciphered a cryptic message on the wall reading "Do not trust it." After some trial and error involving fire traps triggered by stepping on incorrect plates ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] took some damage), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] discovered a safe path using his shield to block the flames. The party then used [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s teleportation ability (via his turtle familiar) to get everyone across safely, but the party had to go back to unlock the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Extinguishing the braziers (using [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Create Water spell and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] smothering one with his shield) dropped the barrier but also opened hidden crypts, releasing numerous [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]] skeletons. The party engaged in combat, with [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam dealing significant area damage and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (using his Giant's Might) delivering heavy blows, quickly dispatching the undead.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The compass leads the party to a ruined temple guarded by a [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]], a stone construct with a purple magical core. During the battle, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] climbs the construct and stabs its back, extracting the glowing orb, causing it to turn red and intensify its attacks. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] retrieves the orb from the ground after noticing a pedestal with a spherical indentation and magical boots floating above it. Zorro moves up to the pedestal, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] hastily puts the orb into the pedestal, unlocking [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] and opening the doors to the exit. The Guardian is glowing red, prepared to give it's all to protect the artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
