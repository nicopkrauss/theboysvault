| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Following their earlier confrontation, the party discusses their escape from the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] reveals she has an invisibility spell, suggesting it be used on [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] since she and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] are disguised in guard uniforms. A debate ensues on how to handle [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s wolf, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously suggests carrying [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] like a scarf to share the invisibility, but this is quickly shot down by the DM. The group settles on pretending [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] is a guard dog. After a successful intelligence check, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] recalls that while guards in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] employ dogs, wolves are unusual but not unheard of. They decide against a makeshift muzzle, opting to trust [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] to remain disciplined. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] provides manacles for [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to complete their prisoner disguises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts invisibility on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], which will last for one hour. The party begins their trek through the city streets as a light rain begins to fall. They decide to take back roads to avoid the main thoroughfare and the fountain they had previously destroyed. Their journey is interrupted when a guard patrol spots them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], still in their guard disguises, claim they are transporting prisoners. When questioned about the wolf, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] successfully deceives the guards by stating they are testing out new prison dogs. The patrol allows them to carry on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | With two guards now following them, the party crosses the bridge and leaves the city proper. Once out of sight of the main gate, the tension among the prisoners and their new escorts rises. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] trade barbs with the guards, resulting in the guards spitting on and kicking [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. When [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] continues to talk back, a guard smacks him. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] reacts by catching the guard's fist and channeling lightning through his manacles as a threat. This escalates the situation into combat. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] immediately incinerates one guard with an Inflict Wounds spell. Seeing this, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the remaining guard, followed by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] biting him. The final guard is quickly dispatched by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s Shocking Grasp, which is amplified by the rain and the metal shackles [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] had secretly placed on the guard's ankles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Now free of their escort, the party finds themselves outside a large, weathered barn as the rain intensifies into a downpour. They hear muffled, mumbling noises coming from within. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the still-invisible [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enter the main barn, while [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] climbs in through a second-story window and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] keep watch outside. The barn appears empty, yet the mumbling sound is pinpointed to a specific area covered by hay bales. As [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] approaches, the hay bales are thrown aside, and a trapdoor opens, revealing a large, brutish figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | The party travels for about an hour away from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and comes across a small, unnamed settlement with an inn. Despite it being late, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] persuades the innkeeper, [[Chester\|Chester]], to rent them rooms for the night. While most of the party rests, the elves find they have four extra hours. This quickly devolves into a chaotic gambling session of Blackjack and Roulette with [[Chester\|Chester]], who also acts as the dealer. The party's fortunes swing wildly, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] losing his money, only for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to win it back and then some. The session becomes a blur of risky bets, borrowed money, and peer pressure from the dealer, ending with the party collectively up on their gold before the innkeeper passes out at the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party, consisting of [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], arrived at the city gates of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They were accompanied by [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], who were recognized by the guards and allowed entry. Once inside, [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] departed on their own errands, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] splitting off from [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]]. A city guard approached the party, questioning their loitering. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asserted he was from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], leading to a tense exchange. The party inquired about selling a sword, and the guard directed them towards the blacksmith or the grand fountain in the city courtyard as potential meeting spots for buyers. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also asked about an artifact shop, and the guard, with some reluctance, pointed them towards "[[Drobber's Drobbins\|Drobber's Drobbins]]."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Following the guard's directions, the party found themselves in a poorer district before locating [[Drobber's Drobbins\|Drobber's Drobbins]], a dinky shop run by an eccentric dark elf named [[Drobber\|Drobber]]. [[Drobber\|Drobber]] referred to all his wares as "dobbins" or "drobbins." The party inquired about specific artifacts, such as mittens and boots with a purple gemstone, but [[Drobber\|Drobber]] claimed to only have regular "drobbins." He sang a song about drobbins that offered no clarity on what they actually were. During the interaction, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] followed [[Drobber\|Drobber]] outside as he pointed towards [[Tim's Inn\|Tim's Inn]] (which has a sign reading [[Apple Inn\|Apple Inn]]). [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] held the shop door shut, allowing [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to inspect a prominent vase, which turned out to contain [[Drobber\|Drobber]]'s family ashes. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] decided against stealing it. When [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] released the door, [[Drobber\|Drobber]] charged back in, accidentally knocking over the pedestal and spilling the ashes of "Mr. and Mother [[Drobber\|Drobber]]'s son," causing him great distress. The party, after [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pocketed a handful of the ashes, decided to leave, flipping the "Open" sign to "Drop In" on their way out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party located the [[Apple Inn\|Apple Inn]], a nicer establishment run by a younger version of [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. They inquired about rooms, which cost five gold per night, with options for multiple occupants. The DM noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Jared's character) was not currently with the party, showing a brief flashback to him at the blacksmith's guild, earning gold by being slapped. The party discussed potential investments with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who suggested the local bank. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then brought up the [[Shardbinders\|Shardbinders]]. Tim revealed they were a notorious cult operating from the mountains, with [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] serving as a military outpost against them. He mentioned their long history of terrorizing the region and frequent, albeit often unsuccessful, campaigns against them. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] also asked about their sword buyer, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. Tim recognized Dingle as an old friend and a regular at the inn, known for his many female companions. Tim suggested the "majesty fountain" in the city courtyard as the most likely meeting place for Dingle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party proceeded to the majestic fountain, a grand centerpiece of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They did not initially see their contact. After [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] unsuccessfully and then successfully (for 10 gold) solicited information from a passing noble, they learned the buyer's distinctive hat (with a bow) was associated with the Bard's College. As they headed in that direction, they spotted the buyer – a man in a red vest and the described hat – walking towards the fountain. They intercepted him. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully negotiated the price for the sword up to 1100 gold. Just as the exchange was about to occur, a blue portal ripped open above the fountain, spewing black goop everywhere. A new figure, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], covered head-to-toe in the viscous substance, fell from the portal, his shirt snagging on the statue's sword, leaving him suspended 30 feet in the air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The sudden appearance of [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the defilement of the fountain drew immediate guard attention, with twenty guards quickly surrounding the party (excluding [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], who was dangling above). [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], after a brief attempt by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to climb and cut him down, used his Fey Step ability to teleport safely to the ground. The guards moved to arrest [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. Seizing the opportunity, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Misty Step to escape the guard encirclement. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and his dog, Sable, also managed to break free. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], finding himself the sole party member surrounded, attempted to reason with the guards but was informed he was being arrested for the fountain's desecration. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], now outside the circle, cast the Light cantrip on the inky fountain water, creating a flashbang effect that momentarily blinded all the guards. This allowed [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to perform an acrobatic leap over the disoriented guards and rejoin the others. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], whose escorting guard was distracted by the flash, turned invisible and also regrouped with the party. To cover their escape, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], using his Giant's Might to become large, smashed a section of the fountain wall, causing a flood of inky water to surge towards the pursuing guards. The party, now all coated in black ink, fled the scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Now outside the city walls around 9:30 PM, the party found themselves in a wooded area. Nearby stood a small maintenance shack and a larger, more ominous stone building with barred windows, appearing unoccupied. Deciding to investigate the larger building, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] successfully picked the lock. Inside, they discovered it was a storage facility filled with barrels of fuel and oil. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] proposed a hazardous plan to remove the ink: douse themselves in oil, then have [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], a fire genasi, carefully burn the oil (and ink) off near a water source. This idea was met with considerable skepticism. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s search for a bathroom in the building proved fruitless. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] experimented by applying oil to one of his gloves; the ink came off, but the glove was now oil-soaked. He then tried rolling the oily glove in dirt, which made it less drippy but still saturated. Undeterred, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] rolled his entire body in a pile of dirt he created with Mold Earth, which helped to stop the dripping but left him still covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Seeing the guards distracted, the party stealthily moved into the maintenance building to take a long rest, the time being around 10:15 PM. They planned to rest until 6:00 AM. However, the guards' conversation outside took a dark turn as the despondent guard (the second one who spoke) expressed suicidal thoughts, "It's like maybe I should just hop into the [water]... What else is the point, man?" His friend, initially trying to dissuade him ("You don't need to don't don't don't talk like that man"), eventually seemed to capitulate, saying, "Brother, if that's what you truly need. [I'll] push you into the water." He then grabbed the despondent guard by the shoulder, and they began to walk slowly towards the water's edge. The party decided to intervene. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] used his Stone Rune to incapacitate the guard who seemed to be encouraging the suicide, while [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] used Mold Earth to create difficult terrain under their feet. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then tackled the despondent guard, preventing him from going further. With both guards now subdued – the instigator incapacitated by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune and the suicidal one knocked unconscious by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] with his dagger pommel – the party had two unconscious guards on their hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] insisted [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] wear one of the guard outfits, but [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] explained his armor was magically fused to him. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to wear a uniform instead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s ink-stained cloak and wore it inside out for disguise. The party then staged the scene with the unconscious guards: [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] arranged them to look as if they were spooning naked under a blanket made of dirt (courtesy of Mold Earth), with their faces clear to breathe. He also dripped a trail of oil from their location back towards the fuel storage building to create a misleading narrative.

| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] questioned the DM about currency inflation due to time travel. The DM decided to simplify by multiplying the party's current gold by 2x, rather than scaling prices. The blacksmith, who eventually introduced himself as [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] after some prodding, offered the party a quest: deliver a newly finished one-handed sword to a wealthy benefactor in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. The benefactor was described as a "city folk" who would be by a fountain in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], wearing a red tunic and a "funny little hat with a little ball on top," which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] likened to Mickey Mouse. The benefactor was paying 1000 gold pieces for the sword. After some negotiation, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], with a successful persuasion check (boosted by the DM for a good speech involving "dingle" puns), secured a 15% cut (150 gold pieces) for the party to deliver the sword. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] warned them to return with 850 gold by noon the next day or face consequences from the Blacksmith's Guild. The party confirmed the deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | Everyone rolled perception. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] was the only one to notice four "curious types" in studded leather armor by the side of the road, not hidden but not clearly armed yet. As the cart approached, one stepped into the road, and the horse stopped. The bandit announced it was his part of the forest and demanded a toll of 20 gold pieces. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted deception, claiming they had more mercenaries following, but failed. He then stepped off the cart to confront the bandit, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] growling menacingly. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] threatened the bandits. The lead bandit snapped his fingers, and eight more bandits emerged from the trees. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] readied a flame, and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] readied an air arrow. The bandits' archers drew their arrows. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], getting a nod from his companions, punched the lead bandit in the face, initiating combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The battle began with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] landing a surprise punch on the lead bandit. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], utilizing Sharpshooter, quickly eliminated an enemy archer with a precise headshot. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] also engaged the bandit leader. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] focused on other melee attackers, with [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s Green Flame Blade arcing to a second foe. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then invoked Giant's Might, growing in size and unleashing a flurry of devastating attacks with his greatsword, felling several bandits in quick succession, including the one [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] had engaged. The cart driver, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], unexpectedly joined the fray, grabbing a sledgehammer and attacking the already wounded bandit captain. Despite some healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took several hits from the remaining bandits, including a nasty critical from the captain. However, the party's combined offense began to turn the tide. Archers exchanged fire, and tragically, the party's horse was shot and killed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] continued to pick off distant foes with his bow, including one particularly gruesome eyeball shot. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], using his monk speed, dashed to intercept a fleeing bandit, knocking him prone with a blast of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], a towering figure, continued his rampage, crushing one bandit's skull underfoot as he moved to engage others. He used an Action Surge to chain together more attacks, cleaving through the remaining bandits. The last few attempted to flee or fight, but were quickly dispatched by the party, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] finishing the final bandit by throwing his greatsword like a javelin. He then returned to his normal size. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the bandit captain's blood-soaked studded leather helmet as a souvenir. The party searched the bodies. They found 70 gold pieces, seven gems (two eye agate, three lapis lazuli, two malachite), one potion of healing, eleven scimitars, eleven light crossbows, one rapier, forty crossbow bolts, one set of thieves' tools, and a small keg of pork from the bandits' nearby camp. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] took the gems and one scimitar. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the potion of healing and the helmet. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] took the rapier and the thieves' tools. The party decided to burn the bodies and disregarded items in a bonfire off the trail, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] handling the pyrotechnics. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] emerged from the cart, distressed about his dead horse (named Friday). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], now out of a job as the cart driver, also expressed concern. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially argued they saved [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s life, but [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to pay 50 gold (25 each to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]) out of pocket for the trouble, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] contributed to. The payment was accepted, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] decided to accompany them, slinging his sledgehammer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

They arrived at the gates of the city without further incident. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] confirmed with the DM that the city was still called [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], implying the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] bloodline still ruled.

After a debate about how Moonbeam movement works, it's decided it can travel, hitting three cultists. One is obliterated, another takes some damage, and the third is virtually unscathed.

He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]].

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks.

[[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands.

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] asks a person for the year, who says it's 902. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] recalls they thought it was 952. The DM, Nico, then reveals the NPC was joking and the actual year is 727 AG. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] looks out a window and sees trees and grass. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] recalls a large tree and confirms it's not there, indicating they are in the past before it was planted or grew large.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party, now joined by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] Ashforge who decided guard duty was less exciting than delving deeper, found themselves leaving the library and entering a rectangular chamber. Inside stood three identical kneeling statues, each with a hand on their sword plunged into the ground before them. Dusty plaques lay at their feet. At the far end of the room was a door with a large keyhole. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a skeleton in the corner and found a note stating: "One speaks only truth. One speaks only lies. Only one sword may yield the key." The party then read the plaques: Statue 1 claimed the key was in Statue 3's sword and that Statue 2's plaque told only truths. Statue 2 claimed the key was in Statue 1's sword and that Statue 3's first statement was false. Statue 3 claimed the key was in Statue 2's sword and that Statue 1's second statement was false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | A lengthy logic puzzle ensued. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] led the deduction, analyzing the statements for contradictions based on the note's rules: one statue tells only truth, one tells only lies. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] initially guessed Statue 1 held the key. After much debate and logical walkthroughs, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] concluded the key should be in Statue 1, based on the assumption that Statue 2 was the truth-teller. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pulled the sword from Statue 1, but it snapped back, the statue's eyes glowed red, and he took 6 psychic damage. However, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] pointed out a potential flaw in the puzzle's design, suggesting two logical solutions might exist. The DM conceded a possible error. Retconning the damage, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully pulled the pommel off Statue 1's sword, revealing the key. Out of curiosity (and perhaps exploiting the puzzle break), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] tried Statue 2 and found a second, flimsier key made of a strange, shifting material. The first key perfectly fit the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | Beyond the door lay a well-lit temple room. Cages lined the walls. In the center, atop a large symbol on the floor, floated a cloak. At the back of the room stood a figure in cultist robes, muttering to himself about being stuck there defending the cloak. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (who were wearing cultist robes from a previous encounter) approached cautiously. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to deceive the cultist, claiming the "Council" had sent them to relieve him of his duty. The cultist was confused, having never heard of a council, and seemed to have been there for a very long time. After a failed deception check by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried again, questioning how they could have reached this chamber if not sent by "him." This deception succeeded (aided by an inspiration point). The cultist, convinced and eager to leave but unsure where to go, was directed outside by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. As the cultist departed, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The doorway revealed the familiar forest clearing where they first fought the Ashforge Guardian near the dungeon entrance – a portal exit. The party emerged back into the mountain pass around 2 PM. On their way back towards Tavirsk, they encountered the exact same setup as their first goblin ambush: a sword stuck in a tree. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] spoke to the tree, which confirmed goblins (_Correction: Bandits_) were hiding nearby. The party confronted the bandits, led by a captain furious about what happened to his cousin "Fred" (_Correction: Initially called Brett by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]_) in the previous encounter. Despite attempts at intimidation (including [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threatening to squeeze the captain's throat like he did Fred's), the bandits, revealing they knew about the relics and were sent to retrieve them, attacked. Initiative was rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] went first, recklessly attacking Gulrath and moving to the edge of a lava pool, threatening to destroy the artifacts. Gulrath summoned Shardbinder cultists. One cultist attempted Hold Person on [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] but failed. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] went huge again, used inspiration on a missed attack, and landed two massive hits on Gulrath (70 total damage), grappling and restraining him with runes and gloves (_Correction: Glove grapple effect corrected to once per rest, second grapple/restrain attempt failed_). Another cultist failed Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot at a cultist but missed. The battle lines were drawn as more cultists moved in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | The party resumed their fight against the [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]]. After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises.

They deciphered a cryptic message on the wall reading "Do not trust it." After some trial and error involving fire traps triggered by stepping on incorrect plates ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] took some damage), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] discovered a safe path using his shield to block the flames. The party then used [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s teleportation ability (via his turtle familiar) to get everyone across safely, but the party had to go back to unlock the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Extinguishing the braziers (using [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Create Water spell and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] smothering one with his shield) dropped the barrier but also opened hidden crypts, releasing numerous [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]] skeletons. The party engaged in combat, with [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam dealing significant area damage and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (using his Giant's Might) delivering heavy blows, quickly dispatching the undead.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains.
