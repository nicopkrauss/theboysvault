| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Following their earlier confrontation, the party discusses their escape from the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] reveals she has an invisibility spell, suggesting it be used on [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] since she and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] are disguised in guard uniforms. A debate ensues on how to handle [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s wolf, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously suggests carrying [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] like a scarf to share the invisibility, but this is quickly shot down by the DM. The group settles on pretending [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] is a guard dog. After a successful intelligence check, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] recalls that while guards in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] employ dogs, wolves are unusual but not unheard of. They decide against a makeshift muzzle, opting to trust [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] to remain disciplined. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] provides manacles for [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to complete their prisoner disguises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | With two guards now following them, the party crosses the bridge and leaves the city proper. Once out of sight of the main gate, the tension among the prisoners and their new escorts rises. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] trade barbs with the guards, resulting in the guards spitting on and kicking [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. When [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] continues to talk back, a guard smacks him. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] reacts by catching the guard's fist and channeling lightning through his manacles as a threat. This escalates the situation into combat. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] immediately incinerates one guard with an Inflict Wounds spell. Seeing this, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the remaining guard, followed by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] biting him. The final guard is quickly dispatched by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s Shocking Grasp, which is amplified by the rain and the metal shackles [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] had secretly placed on the guard's ankles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Now free of their escort, the party finds themselves outside a large, weathered barn as the rain intensifies into a downpour. They hear muffled, mumbling noises coming from within. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the still-invisible [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enter the main barn, while [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] climbs in through a second-story window and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] keep watch outside. The barn appears empty, yet the mumbling sound is pinpointed to a specific area covered by hay bales. As [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] approaches, the hay bales are thrown aside, and a trapdoor opens, revealing a large, brutish figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | The figure, a giant, declares he is looking for "munchy crunchies." [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], thinking quickly, attempts to de-escalate by engaging the giant in conversation, offering to help find him food. He even sings a song in Sylvan, which pleases the giant. A second giant, the first one's partner, emerges from the basement. Seeing an opportunity, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] convinces the giants that the best "munchy crunchies" are back in the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and that the guards there taste better in the rain. The giants, convinced by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s high-rolled deception, grab him and begin marching back toward the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | With the giants heading for the city gates, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] enacts his plan. Once they are clearly visible from the bridge, he uses Misty Step to escape the giant's grasp. He then uses his Fey Step and Expeditious Retreat to quickly put distance between himself and the giants, leaving them as an unforeseen problem for the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] city guard. He regroups with the party at the barn, urging them to explore the giants' basement quickly before they realize they've been tricked. The party descends into the cellar, finding a grim collection of bones, old gear, and meats of questionable origin. Deciding against a long rest in such a place, they agree to leave immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party proceeded to the majestic fountain, a grand centerpiece of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They did not initially see their contact. After [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] unsuccessfully and then successfully (for 10 gold) solicited information from a passing noble, they learned the buyer's distinctive hat (with a bow) was associated with the Bard's College. As they headed in that direction, they spotted the buyer – a man in a red vest and the described hat – walking towards the fountain. They intercepted him. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully negotiated the price for the sword up to 1100 gold. Just as the exchange was about to occur, a blue portal ripped open above the fountain, spewing black goop everywhere. A new figure, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], covered head-to-toe in the viscous substance, fell from the portal, his shirt snagging on the statue's sword, leaving him suspended 30 feet in the air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The sudden appearance of [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the defilement of the fountain drew immediate guard attention, with twenty guards quickly surrounding the party (excluding [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], who was dangling above). [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], after a brief attempt by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to climb and cut him down, used his Fey Step ability to teleport safely to the ground. The guards moved to arrest [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. Seizing the opportunity, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Misty Step to escape the guard encirclement. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and his dog, Sable, also managed to break free. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], finding himself the sole party member surrounded, attempted to reason with the guards but was informed he was being arrested for the fountain's desecration. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], now outside the circle, cast the Light cantrip on the inky fountain water, creating a flashbang effect that momentarily blinded all the guards. This allowed [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to perform an acrobatic leap over the disoriented guards and rejoin the others. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], whose escorting guard was distracted by the flash, turned invisible and also regrouped with the party. To cover their escape, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], using his Giant's Might to become large, smashed a section of the fountain wall, causing a flood of inky water to surge towards the pursuing guards. The party, now all coated in black ink, fled the scene. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party, including the newcomer [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], ducked into a dark alleyway to evade the pursuing guards. They successfully hid as a patrol ran past, oblivious to their presence or the ink tracks leading to the alley. Once the immediate danger passed, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] became visible. He explained his sudden appearance: he was an Eladrin from the Feywild, had been eaten by a kraken, and a portal in its ink sac had unexpectedly transported him here. He then coughed up a lockpick he had swallowed and managed to free himself from the bindings the guard had placed on him before his escape. The party, though suspicious, was now stuck with a new, ink-covered companion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | With guards actively searching the city, the party, still covered in sticky black ink, debated their next move. The DM initiated a "timer" mechanic, giving them limited real-world time to make decisions before guards would discover their hiding spot. After considering options like the abandoned church or trying to scale the city wall, they decided to find a way out of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They stealthily navigated the streets, eventually reaching the city's outer wall. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], using his Mold Earth cantrip, tunneled under the 5-10 foot thick wall, creating a passage for the group. They emerged outside the city, unseen, near a pair of colossal statues overlooking the ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Now outside the city walls around 9:30 PM, the party found themselves in a wooded area. Nearby stood a small maintenance shack and a larger, more ominous stone building with barred windows, appearing unoccupied. Deciding to investigate the larger building, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] successfully picked the lock. Inside, they discovered it was a storage facility filled with barrels of fuel and oil. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] proposed a hazardous plan to remove the ink: douse themselves in oil, then have [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], a fire genasi, carefully burn the oil (and ink) off near a water source. This idea was met with considerable skepticism. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s search for a bathroom in the building proved fruitless. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] experimented by applying oil to one of his gloves; the ink came off, but the glove was now oil-soaked. He then tried rolling the oily glove in dirt, which made it less drippy but still saturated. Undeterred, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] rolled his entire body in a pile of dirt he created with Mold Earth, which helped to stop the dripping but left him still covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | As a guard patrol was heard approaching their previous location near the statues, the party decided against [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s fiery plan and opted to wash off in the nearby ocean. They managed to scrub away the worst of the ink, though their clothes were now wet and permanently dyed black. As they cleaned up, they overheard two approaching guards. The first guard initiated the conversation, saying, "Man. been waiting for our fucking. Little powwow." The second guard lamented, "I know I told you last week it was bad, but now shes just straight up gone. And I don't know, man, I just I'm really glad that I have you to talk with, because this has been weighing on me heavy. And I just feel like I need to have a good long conversation about this." He later revealed, "Dude, she took the kid too, and it's like listen, you can leave me. I can live with that, but she took the kid." The guards also mentioned arresting someone from the "Bard's College" in connection with the fountain incident, noting that the first guard's partner, Brenda's, father had been one of the fountain's architects and the incident had deeply affected her family.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Seeing the guards distracted, the party stealthily moved into the maintenance building to take a long rest, the time being around 10:15 PM. They planned to rest until 6:00 AM. However, the guards' conversation outside took a dark turn as the despondent guard (the second one who spoke) expressed suicidal thoughts, "It's like maybe I should just hop into the [water]... What else is the point, man?" His friend, initially trying to dissuade him ("You don't need to don't don't don't talk like that man"), eventually seemed to capitulate, saying, "Brother, if that's what you truly need. [I'll] push you into the water." He then grabbed the despondent guard by the shoulder, and they began to walk slowly towards the water's edge. The party decided to intervene. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] used his Stone Rune to incapacitate the guard who seemed to be encouraging the suicide, while [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] used Mold Earth to create difficult terrain under their feet. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then tackled the despondent guard, preventing him from going further. With both guards now subdued – the instigator incapacitated by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune and the suicidal one knocked unconscious by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] with his dagger pommel – the party had two unconscious guards on their hands.                                                                               |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] insisted [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] wear one of the guard outfits, but [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] explained his armor was magically fused to him. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to wear a uniform instead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s ink-stained cloak and wore it inside out for disguise. The party then staged the scene with the unconscious guards: [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] arranged them to look as if they were spooning naked under a blanket made of dirt (courtesy of Mold Earth), with their faces clear to breathe. He also dripped a trail of oil from their location back towards the fuel storage building to create a misleading narrative. Having neutralized the immediate threat and created a diversion, the party took a short rest. Their new plan was to have [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] don the guard outfits and escort [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] (as a prisoner) and the cloaked [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (trailing behind) towards one of the city gates, ostensibly heading for the prison, then find an opportunity to slip out of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
