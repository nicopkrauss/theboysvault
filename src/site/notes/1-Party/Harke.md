| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | In session zero, the group discussed the campaign's structure, starting in the wealthy region of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] ruled by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]]. Characters were introduced, including Jared's druid, Harke's wood elf ranger, Mar's fire genasi monk, Dáelian's Shadar-Kai rune knight, and Cat's warlock. The players were tasked with collecting powerful artifacts for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who contacted them for help in his antique shop in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], promising wealth and power in return. House rules were established, including crit mechanics and potion usage, while players were encouraged to develop their character backgrounds before the next session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | Each player revealed their character choices: Jared is a Circle of Wildfire druid, Kat is a warlock, Mar is a fire genasi monk, Harke is a wood elf ranger, and Dáelian Ashforge is a Shadar-Kai Rune Knight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] opened with his Flurry Volley, killing one bandit archer and wounding another. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] went first, recklessly attacking Gulrath and moving to the edge of a lava pool, threatening to destroy the artifacts. Gulrath summoned Shardbinder cultists. One cultist attempted Hold Person on [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] but failed. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] went huge again, used inspiration on a missed attack, and landed two massive hits on Gulrath (70 total damage), grappling and restraining him with runes and gloves (_Correction: Glove grapple effect corrected to once per rest, second grapple/restrain attempt failed_). Another cultist failed Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot at a cultist but missed. The battle lines were drawn as more cultists moved in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a nature temple by splashing water on vine-covered doors. Inside, they found a room with three doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. A plaque above the middle door (Door 2) read "Follow the vowel to exit". [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] detected magical energy from two of the doors, suggesting they were dimensional portals, while one was a true door. After investigating the doors, checking for traps, and examining the plaque (noticing the 'O' in 'Follow' was worn), the party debated which door to choose. The consensus landed on Door 1, as 'One' starts with a vowel and the worn 'O' hinted at a connection. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement.

Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue.

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] investigated the body and found a note expressing frustration that Door 2 wasn't the answer and confusion about vowels. The party found another plaque above Door 2, identical to the first room's, but dirtier. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] wiped it and found the 'E' in 'The' was slightly worn.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a large, well-kept library. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s compass indicated four points of interest. Investigating, they found four relics displayed: two different bows and two different suits of chest armor. They also found three statues (holding a book, a sword, and a shield) and interactive globes. Spinning the globes summoned a curator orb. Through interaction with the orb and finding notes/books (The Rootless Branch, Forged in Fire, Relics of Power, Titans As We Know Them, and several numbered notes), they deciphered clues related to the statues and relics. The statues represented "Defense of Sacred Knowledge" (Book), "Power to Mold the World" (Sword), and "Glory of the Founder" (Shield), which needed to be activated in a specific order by speaking the correct phrase. This revealed hidden rooms containing more notes. The notes contained lore and clues, including dates (interpreted as number codes: 2, 4, 135 for one relic; 23, 3, 37 for the other) linked to the books "The Rootless Branch" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]]) and "Forged in Fire" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]]), which the curator highlighted as favorites. The party deduced these were the two "true" relics among the four displayed. Two pedestals rose in the main room. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] (the red gem armor) and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] (the vine/branch bow) onto the pedestals. This revealed a staircase forward and granted the party the chosen relics. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | With the puzzle solved and relics obtained, the party took another short rest. The session concluded as they stood before the revealed staircase, ready to proceed in the next session. [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] went to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (to potentially trade with George for the gloves) and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] went to [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] received the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] from [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in exchange for the Shard Forest Guardian Orb she picked up earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | The party resumed their fight against the [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]]. After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | After the colossus fight, the party explored the immediate area, finding skeletons yielding a health potion and gold coins taken by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises. They took a long rest, leveled up to 3, and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] gave [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] he found to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. Following a magical compass, they arrived at the entrance to the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], an ancient temple fortress overtaken by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], identified through a successful History check on their shattered heart symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
