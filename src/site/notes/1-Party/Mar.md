| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | In session zero, the group discussed the campaign's structure, starting in the wealthy region of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] ruled by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]]. Characters were introduced, including Jared's druid, Harke's wood elf ranger, Mar's fire genasi monk, Dáelian's Shadar-Kai rune knight, and Cat's warlock. The players were tasked with collecting powerful artifacts for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who contacted them for help in his antique shop in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], promising wealth and power in return. House rules were established, including crit mechanics and potion usage, while players were encouraged to develop their character backgrounds before the next session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Following their earlier confrontation, the party discusses their escape from the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] reveals she has an invisibility spell, suggesting it be used on [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] since she and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] are disguised in guard uniforms. A debate ensues on how to handle [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s wolf, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously suggests carrying [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] like a scarf to share the invisibility, but this is quickly shot down by the DM. The group settles on pretending [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] is a guard dog. After a successful intelligence check, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] recalls that while guards in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] employ dogs, wolves are unusual but not unheard of. They decide against a makeshift muzzle, opting to trust [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] to remain disciplined. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] provides manacles for [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to complete their prisoner disguises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The party begins their trek through the city streets as a light rain begins to fall. They decide to take back roads to avoid the main thoroughfare and the fountain they had previously destroyed. Their journey is interrupted when a guard patrol spots them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], still in their guard disguises, claim they are transporting prisoners. When questioned about the wolf, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] successfully deceives the guards by stating they are testing out new prison dogs. The patrol allows them to carry on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | The party arrives at the main bridge leading out of the city, only to find it heavily fortified. They are immediately confronted by the guard captain. When questioned why they are taking prisoners out of the city, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] claim they are taking the "fountain people" out for a lesson before their official imprisonment. Their story becomes messy as they amusingly claim to be from the "Canine 69th unit." Despite the conflicting stories, a successful deception check from [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] convinces the captain. However, he remains suspicious and orders two of his guards to escort the party to ensure the prisoners are dealt with appropriately. To maintain the ruse, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slaps [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] across the face, asserting dominance in front of the captain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | With two guards now following them, the party crosses the bridge and leaves the city proper. Once out of sight of the main gate, the tension among the prisoners and their new escorts rises. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] trade barbs with the guards, resulting in the guards spitting on and kicking [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. When [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] continues to talk back, a guard smacks him. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] reacts by catching the guard's fist and channeling lightning through his manacles as a threat. This escalates the situation into combat. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] immediately incinerates one guard with an Inflict Wounds spell. Seeing this, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the remaining guard, followed by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] biting him. The final guard is quickly dispatched by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s Shocking Grasp, which is amplified by the rain and the metal shackles [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] had secretly placed on the guard's ankles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Now free of their escort, the party finds themselves outside a large, weathered barn as the rain intensifies into a downpour. They hear muffled, mumbling noises coming from within. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the still-invisible [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enter the main barn, while [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] climbs in through a second-story window and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] keep watch outside. The barn appears empty, yet the mumbling sound is pinpointed to a specific area covered by hay bales. As [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] approaches, the hay bales are thrown aside, and a trapdoor opens, revealing a large, brutish figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | The party travels for about an hour away from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and comes across a small, unnamed settlement with an inn. Despite it being late, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] persuades the innkeeper, [[Chester\|Chester]], to rent them rooms for the night. While most of the party rests, the elves find they have four extra hours. This quickly devolves into a chaotic gambling session of Blackjack and Roulette with [[Chester\|Chester]], who also acts as the dealer. The party's fortunes swing wildly, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] losing his money, only for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to win it back and then some. The session becomes a blur of risky bets, borrowed money, and peer pressure from the dealer, ending with the party collectively up on their gold before the innkeeper passes out at the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party, consisting of [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], arrived at the city gates of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They were accompanied by [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], who were recognized by the guards and allowed entry. Once inside, [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] departed on their own errands, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] splitting off from [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]]. A city guard approached the party, questioning their loitering. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asserted he was from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], leading to a tense exchange. The party inquired about selling a sword, and the guard directed them towards the blacksmith or the grand fountain in the city courtyard as potential meeting spots for buyers. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also asked about an artifact shop, and the guard, with some reluctance, pointed them towards "[[Drobber's Drobbins\|Drobber's Drobbins]]."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Following the guard's directions, the party found themselves in a poorer district before locating [[Drobber's Drobbins\|Drobber's Drobbins]], a dinky shop run by an eccentric dark elf named [[Drobber\|Drobber]]. [[Drobber\|Drobber]] referred to all his wares as "dobbins" or "drobbins." The party inquired about specific artifacts, such as mittens and boots with a purple gemstone, but [[Drobber\|Drobber]] claimed to only have regular "drobbins." He sang a song about drobbins that offered no clarity on what they actually were. During the interaction, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] followed [[Drobber\|Drobber]] outside as he pointed towards [[Tim's Inn\|Tim's Inn]] (which has a sign reading [[Apple Inn\|Apple Inn]]). [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] held the shop door shut, allowing [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to inspect a prominent vase, which turned out to contain [[Drobber\|Drobber]]'s family ashes. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] decided against stealing it. When [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] released the door, [[Drobber\|Drobber]] charged back in, accidentally knocking over the pedestal and spilling the ashes of "Mr. and Mother [[Drobber\|Drobber]]'s son," causing him great distress. The party, after [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pocketed a handful of the ashes, decided to leave, flipping the "Open" sign to "Drop In" on their way out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The sudden appearance of [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the defilement of the fountain drew immediate guard attention, with twenty guards quickly surrounding the party (excluding [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], who was dangling above). [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], after a brief attempt by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to climb and cut him down, used his Fey Step ability to teleport safely to the ground. The guards moved to arrest [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. Seizing the opportunity, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Misty Step to escape the guard encirclement. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and his dog, Sable, also managed to break free. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], finding himself the sole party member surrounded, attempted to reason with the guards but was informed he was being arrested for the fountain's desecration. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], now outside the circle, cast the Light cantrip on the inky fountain water, creating a flashbang effect that momentarily blinded all the guards. This allowed [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to perform an acrobatic leap over the disoriented guards and rejoin the others. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], whose escorting guard was distracted by the flash, turned invisible and also regrouped with the party. To cover their escape, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], using his Giant's Might to become large, smashed a section of the fountain wall, causing a flood of inky water to surge towards the pursuing guards. The party, now all coated in black ink, fled the scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Now outside the city walls around 9:30 PM, the party found themselves in a wooded area. Nearby stood a small maintenance shack and a larger, more ominous stone building with barred windows, appearing unoccupied. Deciding to investigate the larger building, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] successfully picked the lock. Inside, they discovered it was a storage facility filled with barrels of fuel and oil. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] proposed a hazardous plan to remove the ink: douse themselves in oil, then have [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], a fire genasi, carefully burn the oil (and ink) off near a water source. This idea was met with considerable skepticism. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s search for a bathroom in the building proved fruitless. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] experimented by applying oil to one of his gloves; the ink came off, but the glove was now oil-soaked. He then tried rolling the oily glove in dirt, which made it less drippy but still saturated. Undeterred, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] rolled his entire body in a pile of dirt he created with Mold Earth, which helped to stop the dripping but left him still covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | Seeing the guards distracted, the party stealthily moved into the maintenance building to take a long rest, the time being around 10:15 PM. They planned to rest until 6:00 AM. However, the guards' conversation outside took a dark turn as the despondent guard (the second one who spoke) expressed suicidal thoughts, "It's like maybe I should just hop into the [water]... What else is the point, man?" His friend, initially trying to dissuade him ("You don't need to don't don't don't talk like that man"), eventually seemed to capitulate, saying, "Brother, if that's what you truly need. [I'll] push you into the water." He then grabbed the despondent guard by the shoulder, and they began to walk slowly towards the water's edge. The party decided to intervene. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] used his Stone Rune to incapacitate the guard who seemed to be encouraging the suicide, while [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] used Mold Earth to create difficult terrain under their feet. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then tackled the despondent guard, preventing him from going further. With both guards now subdued – the instigator incapacitated by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune and the suicidal one knocked unconscious by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] with his dagger pommel – the party had two unconscious guards on their hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] insisted [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] wear one of the guard outfits, but [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] explained his armor was magically fused to him. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to wear a uniform instead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s ink-stained cloak and wore it inside out for disguise. The party then staged the scene with the unconscious guards: [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] arranged them to look as if they were spooning naked under a blanket made of dirt (courtesy of Mold Earth), with their faces clear to breathe. He also dripped a trail of oil from their location back towards the fuel storage building to create a misleading narrative. Having neutralized the immediate threat and created a diversion, the party took a short rest. Their new plan was to have [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] don the guard outfits and escort [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] (as a prisoner) and the cloaked [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (trailing behind) towards one of the city gates, ostensibly heading for the prison, then find an opportunity to slip out of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] inquired about the distance to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], the capital, which the DM stated was a three-hour journey. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then approached a "fat drunk dude" in the guild hall to ask for transport. The man, after some confusing dialogue about carts being parked outside because they didn't fit inside the room, eventually made it clear the carts were simply outside the building. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] confirmed finding carts outside. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then feigned having forgotten where he parked his own cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | Before leaving, it was noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] the Tortle was paralyzed by fear since arriving at the guild, staring out a window and unresponsive, refusing to leave. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] decided to exploit this by charging onlookers one gold to "do whatever you want to this guy," assuring them [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] wouldn't flinch. A small child paid a gold piece and punched [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in the face, dealing damage. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] encouraged more, and the child paid another gold for a second punch. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously asked if the child was related to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. The child then ran off, and no one else took up [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years.

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky."

[[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] was the only one to notice four "curious types" in studded leather armor by the side of the road, not hidden but not clearly armed yet. As the cart approached, one stepped into the road, and the horse stopped. The bandit announced it was his part of the forest and demanded a toll of 20 gold pieces. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted deception, claiming they had more mercenaries following, but failed. He then stepped off the cart to confront the bandit, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] growling menacingly. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] threatened the bandits. The lead bandit snapped his fingers, and eight more bandits emerged from the trees. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] readied a flame, and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] readied an air arrow. The bandits' archers drew their arrows. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], getting a nod from his companions, punched the lead bandit in the face, initiating combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The battle began with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] landing a surprise punch on the lead bandit. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], utilizing Sharpshooter, quickly eliminated an enemy archer with a precise headshot. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] also engaged the bandit leader. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] focused on other melee attackers, with [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s Green Flame Blade arcing to a second foe. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then invoked Giant's Might, growing in size and unleashing a flurry of devastating attacks with his greatsword, felling several bandits in quick succession, including the one [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] had engaged. The cart driver, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], unexpectedly joined the fray, grabbing a sledgehammer and attacking the already wounded bandit captain. Despite some healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took several hits from the remaining bandits, including a nasty critical from the captain. However, the party's combined offense began to turn the tide. Archers exchanged fire, and tragically, the party's horse was shot and killed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] continued to pick off distant foes with his bow, including one particularly gruesome eyeball shot. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], using his monk speed, dashed to intercept a fleeing bandit, knocking him prone with a blast of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], a towering figure, continued his rampage, crushing one bandit's skull underfoot as he moved to engage others. He used an Action Surge to chain together more attacks, cleaving through the remaining bandits. The last few attempted to flee or fight, but were quickly dispatched by the party, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] finishing the final bandit by throwing his greatsword like a javelin. He then returned to his normal size. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the bandit captain's blood-soaked studded leather helmet as a souvenir. The party searched the bodies. They found 70 gold pieces, seven gems (two eye agate, three lapis lazuli, two malachite), one potion of healing, eleven scimitars, eleven light crossbows, one rapier, forty crossbow bolts, one set of thieves' tools, and a small keg of pork from the bandits' nearby camp. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] took the gems and one scimitar. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the potion of healing and the helmet. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] took the rapier and the thieves' tools. The party decided to burn the bodies and disregarded items in a bonfire off the trail, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] handling the pyrotechnics. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] emerged from the cart, distressed about his dead horse (named Friday). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], now out of a job as the cart driver, also expressed concern. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially argued they saved [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s life, but [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to pay 50 gold (25 each to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]) out of pocket for the trouble, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] contributed to. The payment was accepted, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] decided to accompany them, slinging his sledgehammer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

He then fails his Constitution save against [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam (now with disadvantage from Hex) and takes damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast at [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], hitting for 6 damage (including Hex damage). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes Moonbeam damage. He then channels the artifacts, attempting to pull everyone in. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] succeed on their Strength checks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is now prone with his head in the lava.                                                                    |

Sable attempts a bite attack but misses due to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s AC. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks with his longsword but misses, then hits with a bonus action unarmed strike for 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves the Moonbeam over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], who passes the save but still takes 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands. He performs a symbol and says, "Tata for now," disappearing in a puff of smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Then [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] disappears, followed by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], and finally [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] again (as the last one described). They all find themselves back in the same room, but it's restored to its state before the fight.

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] asks a person for the year, who says it's 902. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] recalls they thought it was 952. The DM, Nico, then reveals the NPC was joking and the actual year is 727 AG. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] looks out a window and sees trees and grass. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] recalls a large tree and confirms it's not there, indicating they are in the past before it was planted or grew large.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | Beyond the door lay a well-lit temple room. Cages lined the walls. In the center, atop a large symbol on the floor, floated a cloak. At the back of the room stood a figure in cultist robes, muttering to himself about being stuck there defending the cloak. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (who were wearing cultist robes from a previous encounter) approached cautiously. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to deceive the cultist, claiming the "Council" had sent them to relieve him of his duty. The cultist was confused, having never heard of a council, and seemed to have been there for a very long time. After a failed deception check by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried again, questioning how they could have reached this chamber if not sent by "him." This deception succeeded (aided by an inspiration point). The cultist, convinced and eager to leave but unsure where to go, was directed outside by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. As the cultist departed, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] opened with his Flurry Volley, killing one bandit archer and wounding another. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 1 teleported the party into a chamber with a chasm and spike traps, facing two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]]. Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 3 teleported the party into another combat room, this time facing two suits of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]]. Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 3 revealed another hallway. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] spotted gold coins and stepped towards them, triggering a pit trap. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] reacted quickly, catching [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with an Athletics check, preventing him from falling and taking damage, aided by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] throwing his rope. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle retrieved the 25 gold from the 50-foot pit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Following the compass north from the main chamber led the party to the steps of the final building. At the door, they found specific indentations: two fist-sized holes in the wall, two foot-shaped prints on the floor riddled with smaller holes, and one larger, head-sized hole in the wall. They deduced these corresponded to the artifacts they carried (Gloves, Boots, Crown). After some debate about whether to place the items or wear them, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] put his gloved hands into the fist slots engaging a timer and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] forcibly shoved [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s crowned head into the head slot, and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s booted feet into the foot slots. The slots tightened, locking them in place momentarily before the trap deactivated and the large door to the library opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
