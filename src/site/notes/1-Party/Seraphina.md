| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 1 teleported the party into a chamber with a chasm and spike traps, facing two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]]. Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 3 teleported the party into another combat room, this time facing two suits of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]]. Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).                                                                         |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening the wrong door (Door 1) teleported the party into a room where three [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton\|Skeleton]]s stood on a 20-foot ledge above them. Combat initiated. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, using a Wild Magic effect to damage enemies and gain temporary HP. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Hail of Thorns. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Eldritch Blast. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam, damaging multiple skeletons. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] used Produce Flame. The party quickly dispatched the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton\|Skeleton]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Following the compass north from the main chamber led the party to the steps of the final building. At the door, they found specific indentations: two fist-sized holes in the wall, two foot-shaped prints on the floor riddled with smaller holes, and one larger, head-sized hole in the wall. They deduced these corresponded to the artifacts they carried (Gloves, Boots, Crown). After some debate about whether to place the items or wear them, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] put his gloved hands into the fist slots engaging a timer and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] forcibly shoved [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s crowned head into the head slot, and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s booted feet into the foot slots. The slots tightened, locking them in place momentarily before the trap deactivated and the large door to the library opened.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | With the puzzle solved and relics obtained, the party took another short rest. The session concluded as they stood before the revealed staircase, ready to proceed in the next session. [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] went to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (to potentially trade with George for the gloves) and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] went to [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] received the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] from [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in exchange for the Shard Forest Guardian Orb she picked up earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
