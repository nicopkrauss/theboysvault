| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | Beyond the door lay a well-lit temple room. Cages lined the walls. In the center, atop a large symbol on the floor, floated a cloak. At the back of the room stood a figure in cultist robes, muttering to himself about being stuck there defending the cloak. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (who were wearing cultist robes from a previous encounter) approached cautiously. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to deceive the cultist, claiming the "Council" had sent them to relieve him of his duty. The cultist was confused, having never heard of a council, and seemed to have been there for a very long time. After a failed deception check by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried again, questioning how they could have reached this chamber if not sent by "him." This deception succeeded (aided by an inspiration point). The cultist, convinced and eager to leave but unsure where to go, was directed outside by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. As the cultist departed, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party proceeded through another door at the back of the temple room, locking the previous door behind them. They entered a small room with a sealed stone door at the back, fronted by five pedestals. Ten small stone boxes with unique symbols lined the room. Upon entering, the orbs carried by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (from the Golem, glowing purple) and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (from the library/crown room, glowing green) began to glow. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] also recalled finding a third orb on the cultist's table (glowing red). The boxes had symbols corresponding to the artifacts: Shardforged Heart (open, purple orb slot), Sword, Hand, Gem, Helmet (open, green orb slot), Ring, Chest, Book, Cloak (open, red orb slot), and Gold. The party placed their three orbs into the corresponding open boxes (Shardforged Heart, Helmet, Cloak). A voice boomed, "Five spheres. Five chances. The path is marked by what has passed." The party deduced they needed to place orbs on the five pedestals in the order they acquired the corresponding artifacts. After some discussion about the order and which symbols matched which artifact (noting there was no 'boot' symbol), they determined the sequence: Purple (Shardforged Heart/Boots - though no boot symbol, this was first), Orange (Hand/Gloves), Green (Helmet/Crown), Blue (Book/Library - representing Bow & Chestpiece acquired there), and Red (Cloak). Placing the orbs in this order caused the pedestals to light up like a Wordle puzzle, confirming the correct sequence. The sealed stone door opened. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] opened with his Flurry Volley, killing one bandit archer and wounding another. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 1 teleported the party into a chamber with a chasm and spike traps, facing two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]]. Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Combat initiated. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, using a Wild Magic effect to damage enemies and gain temporary HP. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Hail of Thorns. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Eldritch Blast. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam, damaging multiple skeletons. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] used Produce Flame. The party quickly dispatched the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton\|Skeleton]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Following the compass north from the main chamber led the party to the steps of the final building. At the door, they found specific indentations: two fist-sized holes in the wall, two foot-shaped prints on the floor riddled with smaller holes, and one larger, head-sized hole in the wall. They deduced these corresponded to the artifacts they carried (Gloves, Boots, Crown). After some debate about whether to place the items or wear them, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] put his gloved hands into the fist slots engaging a timer and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] forcibly shoved [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s crowned head into the head slot, and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s booted feet into the foot slots. The slots tightened, locking them in place momentarily before the trap deactivated and the large door to the library opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The session concluded as they stood before the revealed staircase, ready to proceed in the next session. [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] went to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (to potentially trade with George for the gloves) and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] went to [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] received the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] from [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in exchange for the Shard Forest Guardian Orb she picked up earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
