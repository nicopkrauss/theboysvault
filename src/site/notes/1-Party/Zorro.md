| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 1 teleported the party into a chamber with a chasm and spike traps, facing two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]]. Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 3 teleported the party into another combat room, this time facing two suits of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]]. Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party proceeded down the hallway into an identical room with three doors (1, 2, 3) and a dead body in the corner. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] investigated the body and found a note expressing frustration that Door 2 wasn't the answer and confusion about vowels. The party found another plaque above Door 2, identical to the first room's, but dirtier. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] wiped it and found the 'E' in 'The' was slightly worn. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] deduced a pattern: the worn letter's position in the word indicated the correct door number (O in FollOw = 2nd letter = Door 2; E in thE = 3rd letter = Door 3). They opened Door 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Opening Door 3 revealed another hallway. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] spotted gold coins and stepped towards them, triggering a pit trap. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] reacted quickly, catching [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with an Athletics check, preventing him from falling and taking damage, aided by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] throwing his rope. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle retrieved the 25 gold from the 50-foot pit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party returned to the previous room. After the brief argument about [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opening the wrong door, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] reiterated the logic based on the first vowel's position in "Exit" pointing to Door 1. However, realizing the pattern they followed was 2, 3, 2, 2, the next logical door based on "Exit" (E being the 1st letter) should be Door 1. They opened Door 1, which finally opened correctly, revealing the next area. The DM confirmed the puzzle logic: the position of the _first_ vowel in each word of the phrase indicated the correct door number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a large, well-kept library. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s compass indicated four points of interest. Investigating, they found four relics displayed: two different bows and two different suits of chest armor. They also found three statues (holding a book, a sword, and a shield) and interactive globes. Spinning the globes summoned a curator orb. Through interaction with the orb and finding notes/books (The Rootless Branch, Forged in Fire, Relics of Power, Titans As We Know Them, and several numbered notes), they deciphered clues related to the statues and relics. The statues represented "Defense of Sacred Knowledge" (Book), "Power to Mold the World" (Sword), and "Glory of the Founder" (Shield), which needed to be activated in a specific order by speaking the correct phrase. This revealed hidden rooms containing more notes. The notes contained lore and clues, including dates (interpreted as number codes: 2, 4, 135 for one relic; 23, 3, 37 for the other) linked to the books "The Rootless Branch" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]]) and "Forged in Fire" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]]), which the curator highlighted as favorites. The party deduced these were the two "true" relics among the four displayed. Two pedestals rose in the main room. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] (the red gem armor) and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] (the vine/branch bow) onto the pedestals. This revealed a staircase forward and granted the party the chosen relics. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | With the puzzle solved and relics obtained, the party took another short rest. The session concluded as they stood before the revealed staircase, ready to proceed in the next session. [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] went to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (to potentially trade with George for the gloves) and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] went to [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] received the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] from [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in exchange for the Shard Forest Guardian Orb she picked up earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises. They took a long rest, leveled up to 3, and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] gave [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] he found to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. Following a magical compass, they arrived at the entrance to the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], an ancient temple fortress overtaken by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], identified through a successful History check on their shattered heart symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

They deciphered a cryptic message on the wall reading "Do not trust it." After some trial and error involving fire traps triggered by stepping on incorrect plates ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] took some damage), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] discovered a safe path using his shield to block the flames. The party then used [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s teleportation ability (via his turtle familiar) to get everyone across safely, but the party had to go back to unlock the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | Upon crossing the bridge, the doors opened into a chamber containing the next artifact, [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]], protected by a barrier and four flaming braziers. Extinguishing the braziers (using [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Create Water spell and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] smothering one with his shield) dropped the barrier but also opened hidden crypts, releasing numerous [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]] skeletons. The party engaged in combat, with [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam dealing significant area damage and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (using his Giant's Might) delivering heavy blows, quickly dispatching the undead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] claimed the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The compass leads the party to a ruined temple guarded by a [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]], a stone construct with a purple magical core. During the battle, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] climbs the construct and stabs its back, extracting the glowing orb, causing it to turn red and intensify its attacks. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] retrieves the orb from the ground after noticing a pedestal with a spherical indentation and magical boots floating above it. Zorro moves up to the pedestal, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] hastily puts the orb into the pedestal, unlocking [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] and opening the doors to the exit. The Guardian is glowing red, prepared to give it's all to protect the artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
