| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | Before leaving, it was noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] the Tortle was paralyzed by fear since arriving at the guild, staring out a window and unresponsive, refusing to leave. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] decided to exploit this by charging onlookers one gold to "do whatever you want to this guy," assuring them [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] wouldn't flinch. A small child paid a gold piece and punched [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in the face, dealing damage. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] encouraged more, and the child paid another gold for a second punch. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously asked if the child was related to [[Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. The child then ran off, and no one else took up [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (controlled by the DM) moves his previously cast Moonbeam. After a debate about how Moonbeam movement works, it's decided it can travel, hitting three cultists. One is obliterated, another takes some damage, and the third is virtually unscathed. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle companion then shoots a fireball, eviscerating the remaining cultist from that group. A blue-marked cultist moves to attack Sable but misses. An orange-marked cultist then attacks [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], dealing 6 damage. A cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes him for 7 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The flame then bounces to a green-marked cultist for 3 damage (her charisma modifier). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] then commands her pseudo-dragon to dive into the lava to retrieve the relic [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] lost. The dragon immediately combusts and dies. Several cultists are noted as dead, including the one affected by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam. One cultist attempts to cast Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], who succeeds on his Wisdom saving throw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

A cultist casts Command on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], ordering him to "jump," but [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] succeeds on his Wisdom save. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots the blue-marked cultist for 12 damage. Sable attempts to bite the red-marked cultist but misses. The red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] heals himself for 16 HP and then misses an unarmed strike. The green-marked cultist attacks Sable, but [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses his reaction, Lathai's Warning, forcing the cultist to reroll with disadvantage, resulting in a miss. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves his Moonbeam again, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] (4 damage) and three cultists (8 damage each), killing one. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle kills another cultist with a flame attack. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Green Flame Blade, missing. She then uses Hex on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] as a bonus action, choosing Constitution for the disadvantage, and notes that her attacks will deal an extra 1d6 damage to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes 3 fire damage from [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune. He then channels the artifacts, causing the ground to shake and split further, visually represented by the DM adjusting the map. The Moonbeam is clarified to be a 5-foot radius. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] then unleashes a wave of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] succeed on their Dexterity saves. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] fails her initial save but, after a debate about her position on a rock after teleporting, fails an Acrobatics check as well and takes 5 damage. Sable also fails and takes 5 damage. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] makes his Strength save to end [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s fire rune. He then fails his Constitution save against [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam (now with disadvantage from Hex) and takes damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast at [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], hitting for 6 damage (including Hex damage). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes Moonbeam damage. He then channels the artifacts, attempting to pull everyone in. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] succeed on their Strength checks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is now prone with his head in the lava. |

Sable attempts a bite attack but misses due to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s AC. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks with his longsword but misses, then hits with a bonus action unarmed strike for 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves the Moonbeam over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], who passes the save but still takes 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands. He performs a symbol and says, "Tata for now," disappearing in a puff of smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party, now joined by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] Ashforge who decided guard duty was less exciting than delving deeper, found themselves leaving the library and entering a rectangular chamber. Inside stood three identical kneeling statues, each with a hand on their sword plunged into the ground before them. Dusty plaques lay at their feet. At the far end of the room was a door with a large keyhole. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a skeleton in the corner and found a note stating: "One speaks only truth. One speaks only lies. Only one sword may yield the key." The party then read the plaques: Statue 1 claimed the key was in Statue 3's sword and that Statue 2's plaque told only truths. Statue 2 claimed the key was in Statue 1's sword and that Statue 3's first statement was false. Statue 3 claimed the key was in Statue 2's sword and that Statue 1's second statement was false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | A lengthy logic puzzle ensued. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] led the deduction, analyzing the statements for contradictions based on the note's rules: one statue tells only truth, one tells only lies. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] initially guessed Statue 1 held the key. After much debate and logical walkthroughs, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] concluded the key should be in Statue 1, based on the assumption that Statue 2 was the truth-teller. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pulled the sword from Statue 1, but it snapped back, the statue's eyes glowed red, and he took 6 psychic damage. However, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] pointed out a potential flaw in the puzzle's design, suggesting two logical solutions might exist. The DM conceded a possible error. Retconning the damage, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully pulled the pommel off Statue 1's sword, revealing the key. Out of curiosity (and perhaps exploiting the puzzle break), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] tried Statue 2 and found a second, flimsier key made of a strange, shifting material. The first key perfectly fit the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | Beyond the door lay a well-lit temple room. Cages lined the walls. In the center, atop a large symbol on the floor, floated a cloak. At the back of the room stood a figure in cultist robes, muttering to himself about being stuck there defending the cloak. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (who were wearing cultist robes from a previous encounter) approached cautiously. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to deceive the cultist, claiming the "Council" had sent them to relieve him of his duty. The cultist was confused, having never heard of a council, and seemed to have been there for a very long time. After a failed deception check by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried again, questioning how they could have reached this chamber if not sent by "him." This deception succeeded (aided by an inspiration point). The cultist, convinced and eager to leave but unsure where to go, was directed outside by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. As the cultist departed, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party proceeded through another door at the back of the temple room, locking the previous door behind them. They entered a small room with a sealed stone door at the back, fronted by five pedestals. Ten small stone boxes with unique symbols lined the room. Upon entering, the orbs carried by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (from the Golem, glowing purple) and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (from the library/crown room, glowing green) began to glow. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] also recalled finding a third orb on the cultist's table (glowing red). The boxes had symbols corresponding to the artifacts: Shardforged Heart (open, purple orb slot), Sword, Hand, Gem, Helmet (open, green orb slot), Ring, Chest, Book, Cloak (open, red orb slot), and Gold. The party placed their three orbs into the corresponding open boxes (Shardforged Heart, Helmet, Cloak). A voice boomed, "Five spheres. Five chances. The path is marked by what has passed." The party deduced they needed to place orbs on the five pedestals in the order they acquired the corresponding artifacts. After some discussion about the order and which symbols matched which artifact (noting there was no 'boot' symbol), they determined the sequence: Purple (Shardforged Heart/Boots - though no boot symbol, this was first), Orange (Hand/Gloves), Green (Helmet/Crown), Blue (Book/Library - representing Bow & Chestpiece acquired there), and Red (Cloak). Placing the orbs in this order caused the pedestals to light up like a Wordle puzzle, confirming the correct sequence. The sealed stone door opened.                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The doorway revealed the familiar forest clearing where they first fought the Ashforge Guardian near the dungeon entrance – a portal exit. The party emerged back into the mountain pass around 2 PM. On their way back towards Tavirsk, they encountered the exact same setup as their first goblin ambush: a sword stuck in a tree. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] spoke to the tree, which confirmed goblins (_Correction: Bandits_) were hiding nearby. The party confronted the bandits, led by a captain furious about what happened to his cousin "Fred" (_Correction: Initially called Brett by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]_) in the previous encounter. Despite attempts at intimidation (including [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threatening to squeeze the captain's throat like he did Fred's), the bandits, revealing they knew about the relics and were sent to retrieve them, attacked. Initiative was rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] opened with his Flurry Volley, killing one bandit archer and wounding another. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party proceeded down the hallway into an identical room with three doors (1, 2, 3) and a dead body in the corner. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] investigated the body and found a note expressing frustration that Door 2 wasn't the answer and confusion about vowels. The party found another plaque above Door 2, identical to the first room's, but dirtier. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] wiped it and found the 'E' in 'The' was slightly worn. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] deduced a pattern: the worn letter's position in the word indicated the correct door number (O in FollOw = 2nd letter = Door 2; E in thE = 3rd letter = Door 3).

However, realizing the pattern they followed was 2, 3, 2, 2, the next logical door based on "Exit" (E being the 1st letter) should be Door 1. They opened Door 1, which finally opened correctly, revealing the next area. The DM confirmed the puzzle logic: the position of the _first_ vowel in each word of the phrase indicated the correct door number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | Following the compass north from the main chamber led the party to the steps of the final building. At the door, they found specific indentations: two fist-sized holes in the wall, two foot-shaped prints on the floor riddled with smaller holes, and one larger, head-sized hole in the wall. They deduced these corresponded to the artifacts they carried (Gloves, Boots, Crown). After some debate about whether to place the items or wear them, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] put his gloved hands into the fist slots engaging a timer and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] forcibly shoved [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s crowned head into the head slot, and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s booted feet into the foot slots. The slots tightened, locking them in place momentarily before the trap deactivated and the large door to the library opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | The party entered a large, well-kept library. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s compass indicated four points of interest. Investigating, they found four relics displayed: two different bows and two different suits of chest armor. They also found three statues (holding a book, a sword, and a shield) and interactive globes. Spinning the globes summoned a curator orb. Through interaction with the orb and finding notes/books (The Rootless Branch, Forged in Fire, Relics of Power, Titans As We Know Them, and several numbered notes), they deciphered clues related to the statues and relics. The statues represented "Defense of Sacred Knowledge" (Book), "Power to Mold the World" (Sword), and "Glory of the Founder" (Shield), which needed to be activated in a specific order by speaking the correct phrase. This revealed hidden rooms containing more notes. The notes contained lore and clues, including dates (interpreted as number codes: 2, 4, 135 for one relic; 23, 3, 37 for the other) linked to the books "The Rootless Branch" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]]) and "Forged in Fire" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]]), which the curator highlighted as favorites. The party deduced these were the two "true" relics among the four displayed. Two pedestals rose in the main room. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] (the red gem armor) and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] (the vine/branch bow) onto the pedestals. This revealed a staircase forward and granted the party the chosen relics.                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-19-2025\|04-19-2025]] | With the puzzle solved and relics obtained, the party took another short rest. The session concluded as they stood before the revealed staircase, ready to proceed in the next session. [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] went to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (to potentially trade with George for the gloves) and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] went to [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] received the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] from [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in exchange for the Shard Forest Guardian Orb she picked up earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | The party resumed their fight against the [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]]. After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | Inside the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], the party encountered a bridge over lava with pressure plates. They deciphered a cryptic message on the wall reading "Do not trust it." After some trial and error involving fire traps triggered by stepping on incorrect plates ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] took some damage), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] discovered a safe path using his shield to block the flames. The party then used [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s teleportation ability (via his turtle familiar) to get everyone across safely, but the party had to go back to unlock the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | Upon crossing the bridge, the doors opened into a chamber containing the next artifact, [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]], protected by a barrier and four flaming braziers. Extinguishing the braziers (using [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Create Water spell and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] smothering one with his shield) dropped the barrier but also opened hidden crypts, releasing numerous [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]] skeletons. The party engaged in combat, with [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam dealing significant area damage and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (using his Giant's Might) delivering heavy blows, quickly dispatching the undead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] claimed the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The compass leads the party to a ruined temple guarded by a [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]], a stone construct with a purple magical core. During the battle, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] climbs the construct and stabs its back, extracting the glowing orb, causing it to turn red and intensify its attacks. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] retrieves the orb from the ground after noticing a pedestal with a spherical indentation and magical boots floating above it. Zorro moves up to the pedestal, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] hastily puts the orb into the pedestal, unlocking [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] and opening the doors to the exit. The Guardian is glowing red, prepared to give it's all to protect the artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
