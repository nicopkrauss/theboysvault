# Session Overview
## Arrival in Atavista  
(x::The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.)  

## Journey to Taverske  
(x::The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.)  

## The Ruined Temple  
(x::The compass leads the party to a ruined temple guarded by a [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]], a stone construct with a purple magical core. During the battle, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] climbs the construct and stabs its back, extracting the glowing orb, causing it to turn red and intensify its attacks. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] retrieves the orb from the ground after noticing a pedestal with a spherical indentation and magical boots floating above it. Zorro moves up to the pedestal, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] hastily puts the orb into the pedestal, unlocking [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] and opening the doors to the exit. The Guardian is glowing red, prepared to give it's all to protect the artifact.)
