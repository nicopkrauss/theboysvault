# Session Overview

## The Colossus Fight Continues

(x::The party resumed their fight against the [[3-Mechanics/Enemies/Shardforged Guardian\|Shardforged Guardian]]. After [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] had previously removed an orb from its back, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] placed it on a pedestal, acquiring [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]]. Despite struggling to damage the construct effectively and [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] falling unconscious (requiring healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]), the party focused fire on the weak spot created by the orb. Coordinated attacks eventually brought the colossus down, leaving behind a powered-down orb which [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] collected.)

## Exploring the Ruins

(x::After the colossus fight, the party explored the immediate area, finding skeletons yielding a health potion and gold coins taken by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises. They took a long rest, leveled up to 3, and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] gave [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] he found to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. Following a magical compass, they arrived at the entrance to the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], an ancient temple fortress overtaken by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], identified through a successful History check on their shattered heart symbol.)

## The Fire Bridge Puzzle

(x::Inside the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], the party encountered a bridge over lava with pressure plates. They deciphered a cryptic message on the wall reading "Do not trust it." After some trial and error involving fire traps triggered by stepping on incorrect plates ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] took some damage), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] discovered a safe path using his shield to block the flames. The party then used [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s teleportation ability (via his turtle familiar) to get everyone across safely, but the party had to go back to unlock the door.)

## Combat with Skeletons

(x::Upon crossing the bridge, the doors opened into a chamber containing the next artifact, [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]], protected by a barrier and four flaming braziers. Extinguishing the braziers (using [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Create Water spell and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] smothering one with his shield) dropped the barrier but also opened hidden crypts, releasing numerous [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]] skeletons. The party engaged in combat, with [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam dealing significant area damage and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (using his Giant's Might) delivering heavy blows, quickly dispatching the undead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] claimed the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]].)

## The Vine Door Puzzle

(x::With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.)
