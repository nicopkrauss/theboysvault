# Session Overview

## Item Distribution and Short Rest

(x::At the beginning of the session, it was established that [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], having swapped guard duty with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], left his new gloves behind for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who had expressed interest in them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then offered [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] to the party, feeling it was too much to have both powerful items. After some discussion about who would benefit most, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] took the boots, with the DM allowing them to be attuned during a short rest. The party took this short rest before proceeding.)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 1

(x::The party entered a nature temple by splashing water on vine-covered doors. Inside, they found a room with three doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. A plaque above the middle door (Door 2) read "Follow the vowel to exit". [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] detected magical energy from two of the doors, suggesting they were dimensional portals, while one was a true door. After investigating the doors, checking for traps, and examining the plaque (noticing the 'O' in 'Follow' was worn), the party debated which door to choose. The consensus landed on Door 1, as 'One' starts with a vowel and the worn 'O' hinted at a connection. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 1.)

## Combat Encounter 1: Skeletal Minotaurs

(x::Opening Door 1 teleported the party into a chamber with a chasm and spike traps, facing two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]]. Combat ensued. The party focused their attacks, with [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] using his bow, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] throwing javelins and later raging, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] using Produce Flame and unarmed strikes (boosted by the new gloves), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] using Witch Bolt, and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting diplomacy (which failed) before resorting to Produce Flame and Flame Seed with his turtle companion. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge granted him a retaliatory force damage effect. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] dealt significant damage with Flurry of Blows. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to strategize teleporting the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]] into the spikes but couldn't due to the "willing creature" requirement. The party eventually defeated both [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], with [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] delivering the final blow to the first and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] finishing the second.)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 1 (Return 1)

(x::Upon defeating the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], the party was instantly teleported back to the three-door room. They discussed the puzzle again. Deciding it wasn't Door 1, they opted for Door 3, despite [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s reservations. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 3.)

## Combat Encounter 2: Animated Armor

(x::Opening Door 3 teleported the party into another combat room, this time facing two suits of [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]]. Combat began again. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] effectively used Heat Metal on one suit (Blue), imposing disadvantage on its attacks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacked the other suit (Red). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Green Flame Blade. The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] attacked, with Blue (hampered by Heat Metal) missing [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] mostly, while Red landed some hits on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] initially struggled due to close quarters but switched to his short sword. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged and attacked Blue. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] continued using Heat Metal's bonus action damage and hid in his shell. The party focused fire, defeating Blue first ([[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s blow caused it to fold), and then Red ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] landed a critical hit, followed by [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] finishing it off).)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 1 (Return 2)

(x::Defeating the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor\|Animated Armor]] sent the party back to the three-door room once more. Realizing Doors 1 and 3 were incorrect, they concluded Door 2 must be the right one. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opened Door 2, and it revealed a simple hallway.)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 2

(x::The party proceeded down the hallway into an identical room with three doors (1, 2, 3) and a dead body in the corner. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] investigated the body and found a note expressing frustration that Door 2 wasn't the answer and confusion about vowels. The party found another plaque above Door 2, identical to the first room's, but dirtier. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] wiped it and found the 'E' in 'The' was slightly worn. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] deduced a pattern: the worn letter's position in the word indicated the correct door number (O in FollOw = 2nd letter = Door 2; E in thE = 3rd letter = Door 3). They opened Door 3.)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 3 (Pit Trap)

(x::Opening Door 3 revealed another hallway. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] spotted gold coins and stepped towards them, triggering a pit trap. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] reacted quickly, catching [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with an Athletics check, preventing him from falling and taking damage, aided by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] throwing his rope. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle retrieved the 25 gold from the 50-foot pit.)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 4

(x::The party entered the next room, again with three doors. They found another identical plaque, this time high on the ceiling, untouched. An Intelligence check revealed a potential pattern related to the _first_ vowel's position in each word of the phrase "Follow the vowel to exit".

- F**o**llow -> 2nd letter -> Door 2
    
- Th**e** -> 3rd letter -> Door 3
    
- V**o**wel -> 2nd letter -> Door 2
    
- T**o** -> 2nd letter -> Door 2
    
- Exit -> 1st letter -> Door 1
    
    [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] attempted to open Door 1 based on his own (incorrect) logic, leading to a brief confrontation where [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried to restrain him with vines and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted a flashbang effect with the Light cantrip. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] succeeded in opening Door 1.)
    

## Combat Encounter 3: Skeletons on a Ledge

(x::Opening the wrong door (Door 1) teleported the party into a room where three [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton\|Skeleton]]s stood on a 20-foot ledge above them. Combat initiated. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, using a Wild Magic effect to damage enemies and gain temporary HP. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Hail of Thorns. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Eldritch Blast. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam, damaging multiple skeletons. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] used Produce Flame. The party quickly dispatched the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton\|Skeleton]].)

## The Vowel Puzzle - Room 4 (Return & Solution)

(x::The party returned to the previous room. After the brief argument about [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] opening the wrong door, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] reiterated the logic based on the first vowel's position in "Exit" pointing to Door 1. However, realizing the pattern they followed was 2, 3, 2, 2, the next logical door based on "Exit" (E being the 1st letter) should be Door 1. They opened Door 1, which finally opened correctly, revealing the next area. The DM confirmed the puzzle logic: the position of the _first_ vowel in each word of the phrase indicated the correct door number.)

## The Library and The Relic Choice

(x::The party entered a large, well-kept library. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s compass indicated four points of interest. Investigating, they found four relics displayed: two different bows and two different suits of chest armor. They also found three statues (holding a book, a sword, and a shield) and interactive globes. Spinning the globes summoned a curator orb. Through interaction with the orb and finding notes/books (The Rootless Branch, Forged in Fire, Relics of Power, Titans As We Know Them, and several numbered notes), they deciphered clues related to the statues and relics. The statues represented "Defense of Sacred Knowledge" (Book), "Power to Mold the World" (Sword), and "Glory of the Founder" (Shield), which needed to be activated in a specific order by speaking the correct phrase. This revealed hidden rooms containing more notes. The notes contained lore and clues, including dates (interpreted as number codes: 2, 4, 135 for one relic; 23, 3, 37 for the other) linked to the books "The Rootless Branch" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]]) and "Forged in Fire" (associated with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]]), which the curator highlighted as favorites. The party deduced these were the two "true" relics among the four displayed. Two pedestals rose in the main room. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] (the red gem armor) and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] placed [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] (the vine/branch bow) onto the pedestals. This revealed a staircase forward and granted the party the chosen relics.)

## Session End and Item/XP Summary

(x::With the puzzle solved and relics obtained, the party took another short rest. The session concluded as they stood before the revealed staircase, ready to proceed in the next session. [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Eskaro's Bulwark\|Eskaro's Bulwark]] went to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (to potentially trade with George for the gloves) and [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] went to [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] received the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] from [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in exchange for the Shard Forest Guardian Orb she picked up earlier.)

# Funny Moments

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] threatens to roll to steal the gloves immediately after [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] receives them.

The party spends considerable time debating the meaning of "Follow the vowel," including humorous misinterpretations like "Follow the Volvo."

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] declares he's changing class to Bard (Drummer) while tapping on the plaque.

The [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton\|Minotaur Skeleton]] roars, "All these motherfuckers," speaking fluent Samuel L. Jackson.

[[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tries to negotiate with the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur\|Minotaur]], offering peace if they reveal the puzzle solution, only to be told, "I don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

[[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s multiple Nat 1 rolls on Produce Flame become a running gag.

[[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s Wild Magic Surge causes flowers to bloom whenever someone hits him.

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] declares George will have to fight him for the gloves back after finding them effective.

[[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] contemplates teleporting unconscious enemies into spike traps, leading to a discussion on consent for unconscious creatures.

[[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s insistence on opening the wrong door despite the party's correct deductions, culminating in [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempting to restrain him with vines and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] trying a flashbang.

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] gets repeatedly hit in combat after taunting enemies or making risky plays, muttering about his uselessness in the cave.

The party interacts with the library curator orb, asking increasingly silly questions ("Do you like apples?") and getting literal, unhelpful answers.

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] finds a book, prompting [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to joke, "I think I should read all that himself."

The DM gaslights the party multiple times during the final relic selection puzzle.
