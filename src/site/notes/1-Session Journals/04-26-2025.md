# Session Overview

## The Statue Puzzle

(x::The party, now joined by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] Ashforge who decided guard duty was less exciting than delving deeper, found themselves leaving the library and entering a rectangular chamber. Inside stood three identical kneeling statues, each with a hand on their sword plunged into the ground before them. Dusty plaques lay at their feet. At the far end of the room was a door with a large keyhole. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a skeleton in the corner and found a note stating: "One speaks only truth. One speaks only lies. Only one sword may yield the key." The party then read the plaques: Statue 1 claimed the key was in Statue 3's sword and that Statue 2's plaque told only truths. Statue 2 claimed the key was in Statue 1's sword and that Statue 3's first statement was false. Statue 3 claimed the key was in Statue 2's sword and that Statue 1's second statement was false.)

## Solving the Riddle (and Breaking It)

(x::A lengthy logic puzzle ensued. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] led the deduction, analyzing the statements for contradictions based on the note's rules: one statue tells only truth, one tells only lies. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] initially guessed Statue 1 held the key. After much debate and logical walkthroughs, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] concluded the key should be in Statue 1, based on the assumption that Statue 2 was the truth-teller. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] pulled the sword from Statue 1, but it snapped back, the statue's eyes glowed red, and he took 6 psychic damage. However, [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] pointed out a potential flaw in the puzzle's design, suggesting two logical solutions might exist. The DM conceded a possible error. Retconning the damage, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully pulled the pommel off Statue 1's sword, revealing the key. Out of curiosity (and perhaps exploiting the puzzle break), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] tried Statue 2 and found a second, flimsier key made of a strange, shifting material. The first key perfectly fit the door.)

## The Cloak Chamber and the Cultist

(x::Beyond the door lay a well-lit temple room. Cages lined the walls. In the center, atop a large symbol on the floor, floated a cloak. At the back of the room stood a figure in cultist robes, muttering to himself about being stuck there defending the cloak. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (who were wearing cultist robes from a previous encounter) approached cautiously. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] attempted to deceive the cultist, claiming the "Council" had sent them to relieve him of his duty. The cultist was confused, having never heard of a council, and seemed to have been there for a very long time. After a failed deception check by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] tried again, questioning how they could have reached this chamber if not sent by "him." This deception succeeded (aided by an inspiration point). The cultist, convinced and eager to leave but unsure where to go, was directed outside by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. As the cultist departed, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible.)

## Retrieving Recto's Cloak

(x::With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.)

## The Orb Puzzle

(x::The party proceeded through another door at the back of the temple room, locking the previous door behind them. They entered a small room with a sealed stone door at the back, fronted by five pedestals. Ten small stone boxes with unique symbols lined the room. Upon entering, the orbs carried by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (from the Golem, glowing purple) and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (from the library/crown room, glowing green) began to glow. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] also recalled finding a third orb on the cultist's table (glowing red). The boxes had symbols corresponding to the artifacts: Shardforged Heart (open, purple orb slot), Sword, Hand, Gem, Helmet (open, green orb slot), Ring, Chest, Book, Cloak (open, red orb slot), and Gold. The party placed their three orbs into the corresponding open boxes (Shardforged Heart, Helmet, Cloak). A voice boomed, "Five spheres. Five chances. The path is marked by what has passed." The party deduced they needed to place orbs on the five pedestals in the order they acquired the corresponding artifacts. After some discussion about the order and which symbols matched which artifact (noting there was no 'boot' symbol), they determined the sequence: Purple (Shardforged Heart/Boots - though no boot symbol, this was first), Orange (Hand/Gloves), Green (Helmet/Crown), Blue (Book/Library - representing Bow & Chestpiece acquired there), and Red (Cloak). Placing the orbs in this order caused the pedestals to light up like a Wordle puzzle, confirming the correct sequence. The sealed stone door opened.)

## The Exit and the Ambush

(x::The doorway revealed the familiar forest clearing where they first fought the Ashforge Guardian near the dungeon entrance – a portal exit. The party emerged back into the mountain pass around 2 PM. On their way back towards Tavirsk, they encountered the exact same setup as their first goblin ambush: a sword stuck in a tree. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] spoke to the tree, which confirmed goblins (_Correction: Bandits_) were hiding nearby. The party confronted the bandits, led by a captain furious about what happened to his cousin "Fred" (_Correction: Initially called Brett by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]_) in the previous encounter. Despite attempts at intimidation (including [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threatening to squeeze the captain's throat like he did Fred's), the bandits, revealing they knew about the relics and were sent to retrieve them, attacked. Initiative was rolled.)

## Combat: Round 1 & 2

(x::[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] opened with his Flurry Volley, killing one bandit archer and wounding another. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enlarged using Giant's Might, invoked his Fire Rune, rushed the Bandit Captain, and dealt massive damage (39 total), grappling him. The remaining bandit archer charged [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] but missed. The Captain failed to break the grapple but hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. Another bandit archer hit [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] for minor damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] cast Moonbeam on the archer group on the ridge, killing them all instantly as their turns began. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] turned invisible and used Gale Step to teleport near the remaining melee bandits. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] rushed the new group of bandits that arrived as reinforcements. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] raged, moved to the captain, and attacked non-lethally, shattering the captain's legs and incapacitating him. The combat continued with reinforcements arriving and the party engaging them.)

## Combat: Final Rounds & Aftermath

(x::The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.)

## The Return Journey and Confrontation

(x::The party debated how to approach [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], deciding to take the cart back but feigning ignorance about his betrayal. They returned to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] (now 2 PM) and found the disgruntled carriage driver. After some haggling and intimidation, they paid him part of the fee (25 gold) plus a bonus (15 gold) to take the "scenic route," allowing them a long rest during the 8-hour journey. During the ride, they learned from the driver that Tim Apple was feared, had branded the driver for interrupting him (with the Shardbinder symbol), and that others had been transported to the area recently (including the bandits they just fought). The driver dropped them off not in the city, but at a ruined blacksmiths' guild outside it, where Tim Apple was waiting. Tim led them inside, recounting the guild's history, before descending stairs into a vast chamber below. There, Tim revealed his true form – [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], a Shardbinder who survived the "god's death" – and demanded the artifacts. The party refused. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] began drawing power from the relics, the room shook, and Shardbinder reinforcements appeared as initiative was rolled for the final confrontation.)

## Final Battle Begins

(x::[[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] went first, recklessly attacking Gulrath and moving to the edge of a lava pool, threatening to destroy the artifacts. Gulrath summoned Shardbinder cultists. One cultist attempted Hold Person on [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] but failed. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] went huge again, used inspiration on a missed attack, and landed two massive hits on Gulrath (70 total damage), grappling and restraining him with runes and gloves (_Correction: Glove grapple effect corrected to once per rest, second grapple/restrain attempt failed_). Another cultist failed Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot at a cultist but missed. The battle lines were drawn as more cultists moved in.)
