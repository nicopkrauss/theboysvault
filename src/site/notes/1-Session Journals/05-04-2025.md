# Session Overview



You are absolutely right! My apologies. I've reviewed my notes (and implicitly, your correction is the key here, as the direct transcript provided ends before an explicit XP grant for this specific session was transcribed), and the party indeed was awarded XP at the end of this session for defeating [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and completing the prologue.

Here's the corrected version:

## The Dwarf's Sacrifice and Initial Reactions

(x::The session begins immediately after a dwarf, [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]], jumps into lava. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] expresses confusion and asks if anyone caught the dwarf's name, only knowing him as "the small dwarf." [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] comments on the small racist dwarf. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then turns his attention to the immediate threat.)

## Combat Engages: Round 1

(x::[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attacks the large enemy ([[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]), rolling a 23 to hit and dealing 26 damage, plus an additional 9 fire damage from a fire rune, totaling 35 damage after resistances are considered. One of the cultists, described as a "healthist," moves forward. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Flurry Volley, attacking three different targets with disadvantage. He misses [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] but hits an unmarked cultist (8 damage) and an orange-marked cultist (12 damage). [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s companion, Sable (a dog), moves up and bites an unmarked cultist for 10 damage. A red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the cultist casting Hold Person with a short sword, hitting for 12 damage after a Flurry of Blows. A green-marked cultist attacks Sable, dealing 3 damage. The red-marked cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] for 4 damage.)

## Combat Continues: Zorro's Moonbeam

(x::[[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (controlled by the DM) moves his previously cast Moonbeam. After a debate about how Moonbeam movement works, it's decided it can travel, hitting three cultists. One is obliterated, another takes some damage, and the third is virtually unscathed. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle companion then shoots a fireball, eviscerating the remaining cultist from that group. A blue-marked cultist moves to attack Sable but misses. An orange-marked cultist then attacks [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], dealing 6 damage. A cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes him for 7 damage.)

## Seraphina's Entry and the Dragon's Demise

(x::[[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], being invisible, moves towards a red-marked cultist and uses Green Flame Blade, hitting with advantage for 6 damage. The flame then bounces to a green-marked cultist for 3 damage (her charisma modifier). [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] then commands her pseudo-dragon to dive into the lava to retrieve the relic [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] lost. The dragon immediately combusts and dies. Several cultists are noted as dead, including the one affected by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam. One cultist attempts to cast Hold Person on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], who succeeds on his Wisdom saving throw.)

## Gul'Roth's Power and Environmental Hazards

(x::[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes 9 fire damage at the start of his turn from [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s fire rune. He then begins channeling the power of the relics, causing the room to shake vigorously. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] and a cultist make Dexterity saving throws to avoid falling into lava. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempts a front flip over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] to a ledge but fails his Acrobatics check (rolling a 6) and falls prone. The cultist caught in the lava burns up. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails to make an offensive move but makes a Strength save to end the fire rune's effect.)

## Combat Intensifies: Player Focus on Gul'Roth

(x::[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] stands up and attacks [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] but misses with a 13. He uses Second Wind to heal 5 HP. A cultist casts Command on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], ordering him to "jump," but [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] succeeds on his Wisdom save. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots the blue-marked cultist for 12 damage. Sable attempts to bite the red-marked cultist but misses. The red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] heals himself for 16 HP and then misses an unarmed strike. The green-marked cultist attacks Sable, but [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses his reaction, Lathai's Warning, forcing the cultist to reroll with disadvantage, resulting in a miss. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves his Moonbeam again, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] (4 damage) and three cultists (8 damage each), killing one. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle kills another cultist with a flame attack. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Green Flame Blade, missing. She then uses Hex on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] as a bonus action, choosing Constitution for the disadvantage, and notes that her attacks will deal an extra 1d6 damage to him.)

## Gul'Roth's Growing Power and Ground Splits

(x::A cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (referred to as Drew's character temporarily) casts Command ("swim") on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who succeeds on his Wisdom save. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes 3 fire damage from [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune. He then channels the artifacts, causing the ground to shake and split further, visually represented by the DM adjusting the map. The Moonbeam is clarified to be a 5-foot radius. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] then unleashes a wave of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] succeed on their Dexterity saves. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] fails her initial save but, after a debate about her position on a rock after teleporting, fails an Acrobatics check as well and takes 5 damage. Sable also fails and takes 5 damage. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] makes his Strength save to end [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s fire rune. He then fails his Constitution save against [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam (now with disadvantage from Hex) and takes damage.)

## The Suplex and Gul'Roth's Weakening

(x::[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves, avoiding lava and Moonbeam, but misses [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with an attack. He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast at [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], hitting for 6 damage (including Hex damage). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes Moonbeam damage. He then channels the artifacts, attempting to pull everyone in. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] succeed on their Strength checks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is now prone with his head in the lava.)

## Final Assault and Gul'Roth's Transformation

(x::[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots at the prone [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with disadvantage but misses. Sable attempts a bite attack but misses due to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s AC. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks with his longsword but misses, then hits with a bonus action unarmed strike for 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves the Moonbeam over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], who passes the save but still takes 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands. He performs a symbol and says, "Tata for now," disappearing in a puff of smoke.)

## The Aftermath: Artifacts Dissolved and Party Vanishes

(x::The magma in the room bubbles furiously. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s hand begins to disappear, followed by the rest of him. Then [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] disappears, followed by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], and finally [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] again (as the last one described). They all find themselves back in the same room, but it's restored to its state before the fight. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is gone.)

## A New Reality: The Past

(x::[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] checks his compass; it lets out a puff of purple smoke but points distantly. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] remarks they need to get the artifacts back. A small portal opens, and three items drop out: boots, a cloak, and a bow. The portal closes. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] detects magic on the items and finds their power has been significantly drained but not entirely gone. The party decides to leave the room and go up the stairs.)

## The Guild Hall Restored: A Different Time

(x::They find themselves in the guild hall from before, but it's now fully built and flourishing, with people wandering about. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] asks a person for the year, who says it's 902. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] recalls they thought it was 952. The DM, Nico, then reveals the NPC was joking and the actual year is 727 AG. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] looks out a window and sees trees and grass. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] recalls a large tree and confirms it's not there, indicating they are in the past before it was planted or grew large. The session ends here, with the party now in the main story, out of the prologue.)

# Funny Moments

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] started the session with an enthusiastic and repetitive chant of "HARAS TERANG TERANG TERANG TERANG TERANG TERANG" for no discernible reason.

After [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] dramatically sacrificed himself by jumping into lava, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s first concern was, "did did anyone actually catch his name? Just just the dwarf. I just knew him as the small dwarf."

The DM expressed mock frustration with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s tendency to incrementally add damage numbers: "Every time you're always like, there's five over here. There's fucking 17. Oh, no. Just give me a whole ass number."

[[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], after successfully using Green Flame Blade, decided to send her newly acquired pseudo-dragon into the lava to retrieve a lost relic, only for it to "immediately combust into flames." [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] quipped, "Just going through baby dragons like they're cookies."

The DM mentioned being "harassed by one of the players via text right now," leading to speculation about who the culprit was, with [[Dimitri\|Dimitri]] (a previous player) being a prime suspect.

[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted a "flare" front flip over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] to a ledge, declaring "Like Anakin Skywalker over Obi-Wan," only to roll a 6 on Acrobatics and fall prone. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] offered a sarcastic "Good front flip, buddy."

When [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] summoned shadowy tendrils to restrain the party, the DM quickly clarified, "It's not a hentai thing," much to the party's amusement. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then added, "I was gonna say I've seen this before."

[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], with his mouth magically uncovered by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]] could "take a form of a a taco that poops ice cream," which resulted in his mouth being promptly re-covered.

When the party found themselves in the past, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] asked an NPC the year. The NPC said "902," leading the party to believe only 50 years had passed. The DM then gleefully revealed the NPC was lying and the actual year was 727, exclaiming, "I gotcha!" after the players reacted to the much larger time jump.

# XP

(x::At the conclusion of this session, for defeating [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and successfully navigating the perilous encounter, the DM awarded the party enough experience points to reach a total of 3000 XP. This milestone allowed all party members to advance to Level 4.)
