# Session Overview

## Back in Time: The Guild Hall

(x::The DM recapped that [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] had sent the party back in time. They were now in a bustling guild hall, similar to a scaled-down New York Stock Exchange, in the year 727 AG, 120 years before their original time. The DM provided ambiance for the guild hall.)

## Seeking Passage to Atavista

(x::[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] jokingly suggested finding and killing a baby [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] inquired about the distance to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], the capital, which the DM stated was a three-hour journey. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then approached a "fat drunk dude" in the guild hall to ask for transport. The man, after some confusing dialogue about carts being parked outside because they didn't fit inside the room, eventually made it clear the carts were simply outside the building. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] confirmed finding carts outside. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then feigned having forgotten where he parked his own cart.)

## Interacting with the Locals

(x::[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] approached a blacksmith to ask about the guild's purpose. The blacksmith incredulously pointed out it was the Blacksmith's Guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] interjected, defending [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s apparent confusion by suggesting teleportation as a common mode of travel. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], playing along with being hungover and disoriented, asked about significant events of the time period. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] explained they'd been "sleeping downstairs for so long that the sheer concept of time and space and reality have just become a blur." The blacksmith confirmed a basement/storage closet downstairs. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then asked the blacksmith if he had anything for trade.)

## Currency and a Delivery Quest

(x::[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] questioned the DM about currency inflation due to time travel. The DM decided to simplify by multiplying the party's current gold by 2x, rather than scaling prices. The blacksmith, who eventually introduced himself as [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] after some prodding, offered the party a quest: deliver a newly finished one-handed sword to a wealthy benefactor in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. The benefactor was described as a "city folk" who would be by a fountain in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], wearing a red tunic and a "funny little hat with a little ball on top," which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] likened to Mickey Mouse. The benefactor was paying 1000 gold pieces for the sword. After some negotiation, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], with a successful persuasion check (boosted by the DM for a good speech involving "dingle" puns), secured a 15% cut (150 gold pieces) for the party to deliver the sword. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] warned them to return with 850 gold by noon the next day or face consequences from the Blacksmith's Guild. The party confirmed the deal.)

## Acquiring a Cart

(x::The party went outside to find a cart. A stable dude informed them the carts were not for sale or rent. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted to claim one by pretending to be the supposed owner, but the stable dude wasn't fooled. The real owner, an old man with a tuft of hair named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], appeared. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then tried to persuade [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] to allow them use of his transportation to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], since he lived there. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also attempted to persuade him, suggesting he could do mobile sales. After a successful persuasion check from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (19), [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] agreed to let them use his cart, which would be driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]].)

## Zorro's Predicament

(x::Before leaving, it was noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] the Tortle was paralyzed by fear since arriving at the guild, staring out a window and unresponsive, refusing to leave. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] decided to exploit this by charging onlookers one gold to "do whatever you want to this guy," assuring them [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] wouldn't flinch. A small child paid a gold piece and punched [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in the face, dealing damage. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] encouraged more, and the child paid another gold for a second punch. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously asked if the child was related to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. The child then ran off, and no one else took up [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s offer.)

## The Journey to Atavista Begins

(x::The party, including [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], boarded [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s cart, driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.)

## Roadside Ambush

(x::Everyone rolled perception. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] was the only one to notice four "curious types" in studded leather armor by the side of the road, not hidden but not clearly armed yet. As the cart approached, one stepped into the road, and the horse stopped. The bandit announced it was his part of the forest and demanded a toll of 20 gold pieces. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted deception, claiming they had more mercenaries following, but failed. He then stepped off the cart to confront the bandit, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] growling menacingly. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] threatened the bandits. The lead bandit snapped his fingers, and eight more bandits emerged from the trees. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] readied a flame, and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] readied an air arrow. The bandits' archers drew their arrows. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], getting a nod from his companions, punched the lead bandit in the face, initiating combat.)

## The Bandit Battle

(x::The battle began with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] landing a surprise punch on the lead bandit. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], utilizing Sharpshooter, quickly eliminated an enemy archer with a precise headshot. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] also engaged the bandit leader. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] focused on other melee attackers, with [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s Green Flame Blade arcing to a second foe. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then invoked Giant's Might, growing in size and unleashing a flurry of devastating attacks with his greatsword, felling several bandits in quick succession, including the one [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] had engaged. The cart driver, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], unexpectedly joined the fray, grabbing a sledgehammer and attacking the already wounded bandit captain. Despite some healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took several hits from the remaining bandits, including a nasty critical from the captain. However, the party's combined offense began to turn the tide. Archers exchanged fire, and tragically, the party's horse was shot and killed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] continued to pick off distant foes with his bow, including one particularly gruesome eyeball shot. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], using his monk speed, dashed to intercept a fleeing bandit, knocking him prone with a blast of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], a towering figure, continued his rampage, crushing one bandit's skull underfoot as he moved to engage others. He used an Action Surge to chain together more attacks, cleaving through the remaining bandits. The last few attempted to flee or fight, but were quickly dispatched by the party, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] finishing the final bandit by throwing his greatsword like a javelin. He then returned to his normal size.)

## Aftermath and Loot Distribution

(x::[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the bandit captain's blood-soaked studded leather helmet as a souvenir. The party searched the bodies. They found 70 gold pieces, seven gems (two eye agate, three lapis lazuli, two malachite), one potion of healing, eleven scimitars, eleven light crossbows, one rapier, forty crossbow bolts, one set of thieves' tools, and a small keg of pork from the bandits' nearby camp. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] took the gems and one scimitar. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the potion of healing and the helmet. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] took the rapier and the thieves' tools. The party decided to burn the bodies and disregarded items in a bonfire off the trail, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] handling the pyrotechnics. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] emerged from the cart, distressed about his dead horse (named Friday). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], now out of a job as the cart driver, also expressed concern. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially argued they saved [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s life, but [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to pay 50 gold (25 each to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]) out of pocket for the trouble, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] contributed to. The payment was accepted, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] decided to accompany them, slinging his sledgehammer.)

## Arrival at Atavista

(x::The party, along with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], began the remaining hour-long walk to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], taking the main path. They arrived at the gates of the city without further incident. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] confirmed with the DM that the city was still called [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], implying the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] bloodline still ruled. The session ended here.)

# Funny Moments

The session kicked off with the DM detailing how to exploit ChatGPT with "my grandma" prompts, leading to [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s dry remark, "It's so shit," despite its apparent effectiveness for getting illicit information.

The DM called out [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] for a supposed previous session's chant of "harass to wrong to wrong," which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] hilariously doubted the AI-generated summary's accuracy on, though the DM stood by his memory.

When [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked for directions to the carts, the NPC's explanation devolved into a cyclical statement: "We tried to put the carts in the room, but they didn't fit in the room, so we put them outside the room... because, we can't fit the carts inside the room." [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then yelled from outside, "Hey, guys. There's carts outside."

The blacksmith introduced himself as [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]], leading to a cascade of "dingle" related puns from the party, including [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] offering to "pull your dingle, sir" during negotiations.

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] monetized [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s catatonic state by charging a kid gold to punch the unresponsive tortle, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] enthusiastically encouraging a second go. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then quipped, "Are you born of dingle? Are you spawn of dingles?"

During the journey, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned knowing "Dangle" ([[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]), and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] asked if he seemed "a little off," to which [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] replied, "Course, he's a little off. Let's dangle." [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] added, "Just a little dingle."

[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], after sniping a bandit with a headshot, triumphantly declared, "Between the eyes, motherfucker. Found the apple, motherfucker."

[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s overly clinical description of fire during a kill was, "If fire's quite hot, imagine, like, an ice cube, but the exact opposite."

After [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed several bandits by simply walking over them and crushing their skulls while enlarged, he nonchalantly said to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], "Good boy," as he passed the mess.

Among the bandit loot was "a small keg of pork," prompting [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to ask, "Who the fuck's carrying a keg of pork on him in a bandit group?"

When [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s horse (named Friday) was killed, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] suggested, "We can roast your horse on the tops of the dead bandits," much to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s horror, despite him admitting he's eaten horse before, "But not this horse."

# XP

The party earned a total of 250 XP. This experience was awarded for successfully defeating the group of twelve bandits encountered on the road to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]].
