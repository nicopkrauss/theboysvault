# Session Overview

## Planning the Escape

(x::Following their earlier confrontation, the party discusses their escape from the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] reveals she has an invisibility spell, suggesting it be used on [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] since she and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] are disguised in guard uniforms. A debate ensues on how to handle [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s wolf, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously suggests carrying [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] like a scarf to share the invisibility, but this is quickly shot down by the DM. The group settles on pretending [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] is a guard dog. After a successful intelligence check, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] recalls that while guards in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] employ dogs, wolves are unusual but not unheard of. They decide against a makeshift muzzle, opting to trust [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] to remain disciplined. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] provides manacles for [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to complete their prisoner disguises.)

## The Journey Through Atavista

(x::[[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts invisibility on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], which will last for one hour. The party begins their trek through the city streets as a light rain begins to fall. They decide to take back roads to avoid the main thoroughfare and the fountain they had previously destroyed. Their journey is interrupted when a guard patrol spots them. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], still in their guard disguises, claim they are transporting prisoners. When questioned about the wolf, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] successfully deceives the guards by stating they are testing out new prison dogs. The patrol allows them to carry on.)

## Confrontation at the Bridge

(x::The party arrives at the main bridge leading out of the city, only to find it heavily fortified. They are immediately confronted by the guard captain. When questioned why they are taking prisoners out of the city, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] claim they are taking the "fountain people" out for a lesson before their official imprisonment. Their story becomes messy as they amusingly claim to be from the "Canine 69th unit." Despite the conflicting stories, a successful deception check from [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] convinces the captain. However, he remains suspicious and orders two of his guards to escort the party to ensure the prisoners are dealt with appropriately. To maintain the ruse, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slaps [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] across the face, asserting dominance in front of the captain.)

## The Escape and the Tail

(x::With two guards now following them, the party crosses the bridge and leaves the city proper. Once out of sight of the main gate, the tension among the prisoners and their new escorts rises. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] trade barbs with the guards, resulting in the guards spitting on and kicking [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. When [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] continues to talk back, a guard smacks him. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] reacts by catching the guard's fist and channeling lightning through his manacles as a threat. This escalates the situation into combat. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] immediately incinerates one guard with an Inflict Wounds spell. Seeing this, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the remaining guard, followed by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] biting him. The final guard is quickly dispatched by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s Shocking Grasp, which is amplified by the rain and the metal shackles [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] had secretly placed on the guard's ankles.)

## The Mysterious Barn

(x::Now free of their escort, the party finds themselves outside a large, weathered barn as the rain intensifies into a downpour. They hear muffled, mumbling noises coming from within. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the still-invisible [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] enter the main barn, while [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] climbs in through a second-story window and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] keep watch outside. The barn appears empty, yet the mumbling sound is pinpointed to a specific area covered by hay bales. As [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] approaches, the hay bales are thrown aside, and a trapdoor opens, revealing a large, brutish figure.)

## Meeting the "Munchy Crunchies"

(x::The figure, a giant, declares he is looking for "munchy crunchies." [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], thinking quickly, attempts to de-escalate by engaging the giant in conversation, offering to help find him food. He even sings a song in Sylvan, which pleases the giant. A second giant, the first one's partner, emerges from the basement. Seeing an opportunity, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] convinces the giants that the best "munchy crunchies" are back in the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and that the guards there taste better in the rain. The giants, convinced by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s high-rolled deception, grab him and begin marching back toward the city.)

## A Distraction for Atavista

(x::With the giants heading for the city gates, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] enacts his plan. Once they are clearly visible from the bridge, he uses Misty Step to escape the giant's grasp. He then uses his Fey Step and Expeditious Retreat to quickly put distance between himself and the giants, leaving them as an unforeseen problem for the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] city guard. He regroups with the party at the barn, urging them to explore the giants' basement quickly before they realize they've been tricked. The party descends into the cellar, finding a grim collection of bones, old gear, and meats of questionable origin. Deciding against a long rest in such a place, they agree to leave immediately.)

## A Brief Respite and Some Gambling

(x::The party travels for about an hour away from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and comes across a small, unnamed settlement with an inn. Despite it being late, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] persuades the innkeeper, [[Chester\|Chester]], to rent them rooms for the night. While most of the party rests, the elves find they have four extra hours. This quickly devolves into a chaotic gambling session of Blackjack and Roulette with [[Chester\|Chester]], who also acts as the dealer. The party's fortunes swing wildly, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] losing his money, only for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to win it back and then some. The session becomes a blur of risky bets, borrowed money, and peer pressure from the dealer, ending with the party collectively up on their gold before the innkeeper passes out at the table.)

## Visiting the Blacksmith's Guild

(x::After their long rest, the party travels to the Blacksmith's Guild to complete their original quest. They find [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] still petrified outside, his hands now overflowing with 89 gold pieces from what has become a local tradition of slapping him for good luck. The party collects the gold and updates the sign to "Two gold per slap." They meet with the guild master, [[Dingle\|Dingle]], and give him the 850 gold owed from the sword delivery. When pressed for details about the sword, [[Dingle\|Dingle]] is evasive, only revealing that the magic likely came from the red gem in the pommel and that the buyer, the supposed bard, is connected to a more secretive and powerful Bards' Guild than is publicly known. With their business concluded, the party discusses their next move, leaning towards investigating a local Thieves' Guild to clear the bounty on their heads.)

### Funny Moments

Dáelen, while invisible, repeatedly makes gestures like air quotes and pointing, forgetting that no one can see him, leading to confusion and whispers of a haunting from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]].

To sell their disguise, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] invent the "Canine 69th unit" on the spot when questioned by a guard captain. The sheer audacity, combined with a natural 20 deception roll, somehow works.

To prove to the guards that [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] are truly prisoners, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] repeatedly slaps [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to "assert some dominance" and give him "a taste of what you're getting in the woods, bitch."

The party's encounter with two giants who only speak of finding "munchy crunchies" leads to [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] trying to convince them that city guards are a delicacy that tastes better in the rain.

What was meant to be a short rest turns into an extended, chaotic gambling montage where the party's entire fortune is put on the line multiple times, fueled by terrible advice and peer pressure from the innkeeper/dealer, [[Chester\|Chester]].

The party discovers that slapping the petrified [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] has become a local tradition for good luck. They promptly collect the 89 gold pieces he's accumulated, raise the price to two gold, and give him a bowl to hold more coins.
