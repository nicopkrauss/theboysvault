# Session Overview

## A New Plan

(x::Following their long rest at [[Chester\|Chester]]'s inn, the party awakens to find that [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] has vanished in a flash of light. After a tense and humorous conversation with [[Chester\|Chester]], who passive-aggressively reminds [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] of his massive gambling debt, the party decides they must return to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Their goal is to investigate the Bards' Guild, which [[Dingle\|Dingle]] hinted is more than it seems and is connected to the valuable sword now in [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s possession. Knowing they are wanted by the city guard, they debate the best way to re-enter. After dismissing the idea of sneaking through the sewers, they settle on a bold plan: they will use their guard uniforms to stage a fake checkpoint, steal a cart, and use it as a disguise to get through the real city gates.)

## The Cart Heist

(x::The party travels down the road leading away from the city and waits for a suitable target. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], donning their guard uniforms, pull over a cart. They discover it is occupied by a man, his wife, their three children, and his elderly mother. A moral conflict ensues. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially tries to rob the family of 500 gold, but under pressure from [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], he relents. Overcome with empathy, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] pays the family 50 gold for the inconvenience of taking their cart and horses, allowing them to unload their belongings before the party continues on their way.)

## Infiltrating Atavista

(x::With their new cart, the party devises a new cover story. They decide to pose as a grieving family traveling to a memorial service. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] takes the lead role, holding the urn of [[Dropper's Drobbins\|Dropper's Drobbins]]'s family ashes and pretending it contains the remains of his recently cremated wife. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] drive the cart, while [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] hides in the back under an invisibility spell. They approach one of the main city gates and are stopped for a routine inspection. The guards are immediately suspicious, noting their resemblance to the wanted criminals who destroyed the fountain. However, the party's committed performance and a series of high deception rolls convince the guards. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] successfully guilt-trip the guards for profiling a grieving elven family, and they not only pass through the gate but also manage to extort five gold pieces from the apologetic guards for their trouble.)

## A Beggar's Clue

(x::Once inside the city, the party drives their cart towards the central plaza to see the state of the fountain they destroyed. They find it drained and filled with a black goo, a symbol of local disappointment. To find the location of the Bards' Guild, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] approaches a beggar nearby. He negotiates a deal, paying the beggar 20 gold for information. The beggar points them in the correct direction but becomes cagey when [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] asks about the Thieves' Guild, cryptically telling him to just go to the Bards' Guild and not ask any more questions before walking away.)

## The Secret Meeting & Arrival at the Guild

(x::Suspecting a connection, the party follows the beggar. They watch as he goes through the city bank, out a back door, and into a secluded alleyway to meet with a well-dressed man who appears to be a bard. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], still invisible, gets close enough to overhear their coded exchange. The meeting is short, ending with the beggar saying, "Let the music play." Convinced they are on the right track, the party regroups and proceeds to the location the beggar indicated. They arrive before a lavish, three-story building made of polished white stone, with stained-glass windows depicting musicians. Beautiful music emanates from within, confirming they have found the Bards' Guild. The session ends as they park their stolen cart and contemplate their next move.)

### Funny Moments

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], tasked with pretending to be a grieving widower, invents a wild backstory on the fly, claiming his wife died in a fiery accident caused by "the heat of hash" and that he personally cremated her.

The party's conversation with [[Chester\|Chester]] the innkeeper devolves into an awkward, passive-aggressive confrontation where he repeatedly reminds [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] of his 5,000 gold debt and the far-reaching influence of the "circle of innkeepers."

After successfully fooling the city guards with their grieving family story, the party doesn't just settle for entry; they manage to guilt-trip the guards for profiling them and walk away with five gold pieces for their emotional distress.

The party decides to make their traveling slap-based money farm a reality, debating what to charge people to slap [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] to help him pay off his debts.
