# Session Overview
## A New Plan

(x::The party awakens at [[Chester\|Chester]]'s inn after a night of rest and chaotic gambling. As they convene, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] vanishes before their eyes in a flash of light, leaving them to ponder their next move. After another tense and humorous conversation with [[Chester\|Chester]], who passive-aggressively reminds [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] of his massive gambling debt, the party decides they must return to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Their primary objective is to investigate the Bards' Guild, which [[Dingle\|Dingle]] hinted is more than it seems and is connected to the valuable sword now in [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s possession. Knowing they are wanted by the city guard, they debate the best way to re-enter. After dismissing the idea of sneaking through the sewers, they settle on a bold plan: they will use their guard uniforms to stage a fake checkpoint, steal a cart, and use it as a disguise to get through the real city gates.)

## The Cart Heist

(x::The party travels down the road leading away from the city and sets up their impromptu checkpoint. They wait for a suitable target and pull over a passing cart. To their surprise, it is occupied by a man, his wife, their three children, and his elderly mother. A moral conflict ensues. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially tries to rob the family of 500 gold, but under pressure from [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], he relents. Overcome with empathy, [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] pays the family 50 gold for the inconvenience of taking their cart and horses, allowing them to unload their belongings before the party continues on their way.)

## Infiltrating Atavista

(x::With their newly acquired cart, the party devises a cover story. They decide to pose as a grieving family traveling to a memorial service. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] takes the lead role, holding the urn of [[Dropper's Drobbins\|Dropper's Drobbins]]'s family ashes and pretending it contains the remains of his recently cremated wife. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] drive the cart, while [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] hides in the back under an invisibility spell. They approach one of the main city gates and are stopped for a routine inspection. The guards are immediately suspicious, noting their resemblance to the wanted criminals who destroyed the fountain. However, the party's committed performance and a series of high deception rolls convince the guards. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] successfully guilt-trip the guards for profiling a grieving elven family, and they not only pass through the gate but also manage to extort five gold pieces from the apologetic guards for their trouble.)

## A Beggar's Clue

(x::Once inside the city, the party drives their cart towards the central plaza to see the state of the fountain they destroyed. They find it drained and filled with a black goo, a symbol of local disappointment. To find the location of the Bards' Guild, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] approaches a beggar nearby. He negotiates a deal, paying the beggar 20 gold for information. The beggar points them in the correct direction but becomes cagey when [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] asks about the Thieves' Guild, cryptically telling him to just go to the Bards' Guild and not ask any more questions before walking away.)

## The Secret Meeting & Arrival at the Guild

(x::Suspecting a connection, the party follows the beggar at a distance. They watch as he goes through the city bank, out a back door, and into a secluded alleyway to meet with a well-dressed man who appears to be a bard. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], still invisible, gets close enough to overhear their coded exchange. The meeting is short, ending with the beggar saying, "Let the music play." Convinced they are on the right track, the party regroups and proceeds to the location the beggar indicated. They arrive before a lavish, three-story building made of polished white stone, with stained-glass windows depicting musicians. Beautiful music emanates from within, confirming they have found the Bards' Guild. The session ends as they park their stolen cart and prepare to enter.)

## Entering the Bards' Guild

(x::The party enters the lavish Bards' Guild and is immediately met by the imposing Headmistress, [[Allara\|Allara]]. They attempt to use the code phrase "let the music play," but it fails, leading to a tense conversation where [[Allara\|Allara]] questions their purpose. Feeling the pressure, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] reveals himself from invisibility and presents the valuable sword. The sight of the sword prompts [[Allara\|Allara]] to call for security, but she also offers the party a path forward: to get the information they seek, they must all join the guild, which requires passing an audition.)

## The Auditions

(x::[[Allara\|Allara]] leads the party to a large performance hall where each member must face a trial suited to the guild's "skill set." )
(x::**[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s Trial:** His trial is a test of synergy with his wolf, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]]. He is tasked with tracking a small mechanical rabbit through a field of obstacles and pinning its silver ribbon to a wall with a single arrow shot, without hitting the rabbit's body. Through clever use of [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] to corner the rabbit and precise aim, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] successfully passes his test.)
(x::**[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s Trial:** His challenge is a test of acrobatics and silence. He must cross a large grid of pressure plates laid out on the floor. With a series of successful acrobatics checks, he gracefully leaps from one safe tile to another, clearing the course without a single misstep.)
(x::**[[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s Trial:** His audition is a test of persuasion and presence. He is asked to tell the story of his upbringing to a room full of guild members. He is immediately heckled by a man with a drum. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] responds by using his Enlarge ability, intimidating the heckler into silence and winning over the rest of the crowd.)
(x::**[[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s Trial:** Her test is one of magic and clever thinking. She must light a lantern on the far side of a wide chasm filled with a magic-dampening mist. Unable to see the other side to use Misty Step, she casts Light on her sword and throws it across the chasm. Now able to see her destination, she teleports across and lights the lantern, completing the final trial.)

## The Gilded Hand & The Mission

(x::Having all successfully passed their auditions, Headmistress [[Allara\|Allara]] congratulates them and reveals the guild's true nature. The sun pattern on the floor retracts, revealing a hidden spiral staircase leading down. She confirms their suspicions: the Bards' Guild is merely a front for a more clandestine organization known as the Gilded Hand, the city's Thieves' Guild. She also confirms they have a secret entrance through the sewers. As new members, the party is given their first mission: the man they were meant to deliver the sword to, [[Corvin\|Corvin]], is a crucial member of their organization and is being held in the maximum-security wing of the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] prison. The party's task is to break him out. In return, the Gilded Hand will use its resources to clear their names and explain the mystery of the sword. After a tense negotiation led by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], a payment of 1300 gold is agreed upon, with 500 gold paid upfront. As a welcoming gift, each party member is allowed to take one item from the guild's armory.)

## Casing the Prison

(x::With a clear objective, the party decides to gather intelligence. Disguising themselves in guard uniforms and with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] wearing a conspicuous Hello Kitty cloak provided by [[Allara\|Allara]], they travel to the prison's vicinity. They park their cart a safe distance away and begin a four-hour surveillance of the main entrance. During this time, they learn valuable information: they witness the main guard shift change at 6:00 PM, note the procedure for opening the large metal gate, and see a prisoner transport cart arrive and be admitted. This gives them a baseline understanding of the prison's external security.)

## The Drunken Pony

(x::While watching the shift change, the party overhears the off-duty guards mention heading to a tavern called The Drunken Pony. Deciding to gather more information, they change into common clothes and enter the bar, which is filled almost exclusively with guards. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] strikes up a conversation with a civilian named [[Paul\|Paul]], whose father was a guard. [[Paul\|Paul]] reveals that due to the "Fountaingate" incident, the city guard is stretched thin, hiring inexperienced recruits, and will be holding open tryouts the very next day. Meanwhile, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], on his third "Drunken Pony" special, is overcome by the "spirit of the horse" and begins sprinting uncontrollably in laps around the tavern until a guard trips him. This leads to a confrontation where [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his Stone Rune to magically incapacitate the guard, forcing him to reveal that their target, [[Corvin\|Corvin]], is being held in the maximum-security section of the prison.)

### Funny Moments

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], tasked with pretending to be a grieving widower, invents a wild backstory on the fly, claiming his wife died in a fiery accident caused by "the heat of hash" and that he personally cremated her.

The party's conversation with [[Chester\|Chester]] the innkeeper devolves into an awkward, passive-aggressive confrontation where he repeatedly reminds [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] of his 5,000 gold debt and the far-reaching influence of the "circle of innkeepers."

During his audition, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] is heckled by a man chanting "Nobody cares!" He responds by enlarging himself to a massive size and intimidating the man so thoroughly that he wets his pants in front of the entire guild, who then change their chant to "He pissed his pants!"

After downing three "Drunken Pony" specialty drinks, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] is possessed by the "spirit of the horse," causing him to sprint uncontrollably in laps around the tavern until he is tripped by a guard.
