# Session Overview
## Casing the Prison

(x::With their mission from the Gilded Hand clear, the party decides to gather intelligence on the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] prison. Disguising themselves in their newly acquired guard uniforms—and with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] wearing a conspicuous Hello Kitty cloak provided by [[Allara\|Allara]]—they travel to the prison's vicinity. They park their stolen cart a safe distance away and begin a four-hour surveillance of the main entrance. During this time, they learn valuable information: they witness the main guard shift change at 6:00 PM, note the procedure for opening the large metal gate, and see a prisoner transport cart arrive and be admitted. This gives them a baseline understanding of the prison's external security.)

## The Drunken Pony

(x::While watching the shift change, the party overhears the off-duty guards mention heading to a tavern called The Drunken Pony. Deciding to gather more information, they change into common clothes and enter the bar, which is filled almost exclusively with guards. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] strikes up a conversation with a civilian named [[Paul\|Paul]], whose father was a guard. [[Paul\|Paul]] reveals that due to the "Fountaingate" incident, the city guard is stretched thin, hiring inexperienced recruits, and will be holding open tryouts the very next day. Meanwhile, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], on his third "Drunken Pony" special, is overcome by the "spirit of the horse," causing him to sprint uncontrollably in laps around the tavern until a guard trips him. This leads to a confrontation where [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his Stone Rune to magically incapacitate the guard, forcing him to reveal that their target, [[Corvin\|Corvin]], is being held in the maximum-security section of the prison.)

## The Guard Tryouts: A Path into the Prison

(x::Armed with this new information, the party decides their best way into the prison is to join the guard. The next morning, they join a crowd of hopeful recruits outside the prison gates. They are addressed by a stern Sergeant Stonehand who lays out the three trials they must pass: The Wall Run, The Shakedown, and The Gauntlet. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] manages to get another recruit, Grell, thrown out before the trials even begin by cleverly tricking the Sergeant into thinking Grell made a disruptive comment.)

## Trial 1: The Wall Run

(x::The first trial is a grueling five-lap run around the uneven, obstacle-laden prison walls. The recruits are sent in heats, with the party all being placed in the second group along with their new acquaintance, [[Paul\|Paul]]. Throughout the run, they must make Constitution saving throws to stave off exhaustion. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] manage the run with only minor fatigue. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], struggling more, is helped by [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], and they cross the finish line together. Despite the party's efforts to encourage him, [[Paul\|Paul]] fails to complete the final lap and is disqualified.)

## Trial 2: The Shakedown

(x::The remaining recruits are taken into a cell block for the second trial. Each must individually search three cells, each containing a "prisoner" (an undercover guard), to find what is hidden. The party excels at this task. Through a combination of intimidation, clever deduction, and thorough searching, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] each successfully find the hidden items (a note and a shiv) and correctly identify that the third prisoner is a decoy with nothing to hide, thus passing the trial.)

## Trial 3: The Gauntlet

(x::For the final trial, the remaining recruits are pitted against veteran guards in a non-lethal combat using blunt weapons. The party—[[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]—is grouped together to face three guards, while [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] fails his trial in a separate breakout room and is escorted out. A chaotic brawl ensues. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] uses Tasha's Hideous Laughter to incapacitate one guard, while [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] engage the others. The fight is intense, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] eventually being knocked unconscious after taking a critical hit. However, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] lands his own critical hit with his bow, taking down one guard, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s earlier damage allows him to finish off another, leaving the party victorious but with one member having failed the trial.)

## New Recruits

(x::At the conclusion of the tryouts, the Sergeant announces the results. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] have passed all three trials and are officially welcomed into the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] City Guard. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], having been knocked out, fails the final trial and is escorted out of the prison. The newly inducted guards are given their uniforms and told to report for their first shift at 9:00 AM the next morning, giving them the perfect opportunity to begin planning their prison break from the inside.)

### Funny Moments

(x::[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], pretending to be a grieving widower to get through the city gates, invents a wild backstory on the fly, claiming his wife died in a fiery accident caused by "the heat of hash" and that he personally cremated her.)

(x::The party's new acquaintance, [[Paul\|Paul]], a perpetual failure at the guard tryouts, becomes a running gag as they repeatedly encounter him, offer him half-hearted encouragement, and then watch him fail once again after they refuse to help him during the race.)

(x::After downing three "Drunken Pony" specialty drinks, [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] is possessed by the "spirit of the horse," causing him to sprint uncontrollably in laps around the tavern until he is tripped by a guard.)
