## Overview
[[Atavista]] is the capital of Cirano and one of the wealthiest cities on the continent of [[Fandor]]. Its glittering architecture and bustling trade districts draw merchants and nobles from afar. Though prosperous and peaceful on the surface, the lower districts still carry scars from a famine three years ago. The city thrives near the [[Alonian Sea]], with ships coming and going daily.
