# Atavista
## Overview
[[2-World/Cirano/Atavista\|Atavista]] is the capital of Cirano and one of the wealthiest cities on the continent of [[Fandor\|Fandor]].

Though prosperous and peaceful on the surface, the lower districts still carry scars from a famine three years ago. The city thrives near the [[Alonian Sea\|Alonian Sea]], with ships coming and going daily.
