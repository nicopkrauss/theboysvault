# Atavista
## Overview
[[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] is the capital of Cirano and one of the wealthiest cities on the continent of [[Fandor\|Fandor]]. Its glittering architecture and bustling trade districts draw merchants and nobles from afar. Though prosperous and peaceful on the surface, the lower districts still carry scars from a famine three years ago. The city thrives near the [[Alonian Sea\|Alonian Sea]], with ships coming and going daily.

| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | In session zero, the group discussed the campaign's structure, starting in the wealthy region of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] ruled by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]]. Characters were introduced, including Jared's druid, Harke's wood elf ranger, Mar's fire genasi monk, Dáelian's Shadar-Kai rune knight, and Cat's warlock. The players were tasked with collecting powerful artifacts for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who contacted them for help in his antique shop in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], promising wealth and power in return. House rules were established, including crit mechanics and potion usage, while players were encouraged to develop their character backgrounds before the next session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] jokingly suggested finding and killing a baby [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] inquired about the distance to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], the capital, which the DM stated was a three-hour journey. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then approached a "fat drunk dude" in the guild hall to ask for transport. The man, after some confusing dialogue about carts being parked outside because they didn't fit inside the room, eventually made it clear the carts were simply outside the building. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] confirmed finding carts outside. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then feigned having forgotten where he parked his own cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] questioned the DM about currency inflation due to time travel. The DM decided to simplify by multiplying the party's current gold by 2x, rather than scaling prices. The blacksmith, who eventually introduced himself as [[Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] after some prodding, offered the party a quest: deliver a newly finished one-handed sword to a wealthy benefactor in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. The benefactor was described as a "city folk" who would be by a fountain in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], wearing a red tunic and a "funny little hat with a little bow on top," which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] likened to Mickey Mouse. The benefactor was paying 1000 gold pieces for the sword. After some negotiation, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], with a successful persuasion check (boosted by the DM for a good speech involving "dingle" puns), secured a 15% cut (150 gold pieces) for the party to deliver the sword. [[Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] warned them to return with 850 gold by noon the next day or face consequences from the Blacksmith's Guild. The party confirmed the deal. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party went outside to find a cart. A stable dude informed them the carts were not for sale or rent. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted to claim one by pretending to be the supposed owner, but the stable dude wasn't fooled. The real owner, an old man with a tuft of hair named [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], appeared. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then tried to persuade [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] to allow them use of his transportation to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], since he lived there. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also attempted to persuade him, suggesting he could do mobile sales. After a successful persuasion check from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (19), [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] agreed to let them use his cart, which would be driven by [[Singer\|Singer]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

[[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, along with [[Singer\|Singer]], began the remaining hour-long walk to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], taking the main path. They arrived at the gates of the city without further incident. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] confirmed with the DM that the city was still called [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], implying the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] bloodline still ruled. The session ended here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
