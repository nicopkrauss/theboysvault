# Atavista
## Overview
[[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] is the capital of Cirano and one of the wealthiest cities on the continent of [[Fandor\|Fandor]]. Its glittering architecture and bustling trade districts draw merchants and nobles from afar. Though prosperous and peaceful on the surface, the lower districts still carry scars from a famine three years ago. The city thrives near the [[Alonian Sea\|Alonian Sea]], with ships coming and going daily.

| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | In session zero, the group discussed the campaign's structure, starting in the wealthy region of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] ruled by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]]. Characters were introduced, including Jared's druid, Harke's wood elf ranger, Mar's fire genasi monk, Dáelian's Shadar-Kai rune knight, and Cat's warlock. The players were tasked with collecting powerful artifacts for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who contacted them for help in his antique shop in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], promising wealth and power in return. House rules were established, including crit mechanics and potion usage, while players were encouraged to develop their character backgrounds before the next session. |

| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelian\|Dáelian]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.                                                                                                           |
