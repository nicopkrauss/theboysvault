# Atavista
## Overview
[[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] is the capital of Cirano and one of the wealthiest cities on the continent of [[Fandor\|Fandor]]. Its glittering architecture and bustling trade districts draw merchants and nobles from afar. Though prosperous and peaceful on the surface, the lower districts still carry scars from a famine three years ago. The city thrives near the [[Alonian Sea\|Alonian Sea]], with ships coming and going daily.

| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | In session zero, the group discussed the campaign's structure, starting in the wealthy region of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] ruled by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]]. Characters were introduced, including Jared's druid, Harke's wood elf ranger, Mar's fire genasi monk, Dáelian's Shadar-Kai rune knight, and Cat's warlock. The players were tasked with collecting powerful artifacts for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who contacted them for help in his antique shop in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], promising wealth and power in return. House rules were established, including crit mechanics and potion usage, while players were encouraged to develop their character backgrounds before the next session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | Following their earlier confrontation, the party discusses their escape from the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] reveals she has an invisibility spell, suggesting it be used on [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]] since she and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] are disguised in guard uniforms. A debate ensues on how to handle [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s wolf, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously suggests carrying [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] like a scarf to share the invisibility, but this is quickly shot down by the DM. The group settles on pretending [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] is a guard dog. After a successful intelligence check, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] recalls that while guards in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] employ dogs, wolves are unusual but not unheard of. They decide against a makeshift muzzle, opting to trust [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] to remain disciplined. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] provides manacles for [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to complete their prisoner disguises.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | The figure, a giant, declares he is looking for "munchy crunchies." [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], thinking quickly, attempts to de-escalate by engaging the giant in conversation, offering to help find him food. He even sings a song in Sylvan, which pleases the giant. A second giant, the first one's partner, emerges from the basement. Seeing an opportunity, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] convinces the giants that the best "munchy crunchies" are back in the city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and that the guards there taste better in the rain. The giants, convinced by [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]'s high-rolled deception, grab him and begin marching back toward the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | With the giants heading for the city gates, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] enacts his plan. Once they are clearly visible from the bridge, he uses Misty Step to escape the giant's grasp. He then uses his Fey Step and Expeditious Retreat to quickly put distance between himself and the giants, leaving them as an unforeseen problem for the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] city guard. He regroups with the party at the barn, urging them to explore the giants' basement quickly before they realize they've been tricked. The party descends into the cellar, finding a grim collection of bones, old gear, and meats of questionable origin. Deciding against a long rest in such a place, they agree to leave immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[1-Session Journals/06-15-2025\|06-15-2025]] | The party travels for about an hour away from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] and comes across a small, unnamed settlement with an inn. Despite it being late, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] persuades the innkeeper, [[Chester\|Chester]], to rent them rooms for the night. While most of the party rests, the elves find they have four extra hours. This quickly devolves into a chaotic gambling session of Blackjack and Roulette with [[Chester\|Chester]], who also acts as the dealer. The party's fortunes swing wildly, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] losing his money, only for [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] to win it back and then some. The session becomes a blur of risky bets, borrowed money, and peer pressure from the dealer, ending with the party collectively up on their gold before the innkeeper passes out at the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party, consisting of [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], arrived at the city gates of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They were accompanied by [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], who were recognized by the guards and allowed entry. Once inside, [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] departed on their own errands, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] splitting off from [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]]. A city guard approached the party, questioning their loitering. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asserted he was from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], leading to a tense exchange. The party inquired about selling a sword, and the guard directed them towards the blacksmith or the grand fountain in the city courtyard as potential meeting spots for buyers. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also asked about an artifact shop, and the guard, with some reluctance, pointed them towards "[[Drobber's Drobbins\|Drobber's Drobbins]]."                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party proceeded to the majestic fountain, a grand centerpiece of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They did not initially see their contact. After [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] unsuccessfully and then successfully (for 10 gold) solicited information from a passing noble, they learned the buyer's distinctive hat (with a bow) was associated with the Bard's College. As they headed in that direction, they spotted the buyer – a man in a red vest and the described hat – walking towards the fountain. They intercepted him. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] successfully negotiated the price for the sword up to 1100 gold. Just as the exchange was about to occur, a blue portal ripped open above the fountain, spewing black goop everywhere. A new figure, [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], covered head-to-toe in the viscous substance, fell from the portal, his shirt snagging on the statue's sword, leaving him suspended 30 feet in the air.                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | With guards actively searching the city, the party, still covered in sticky black ink, debated their next move. The DM initiated a "timer" mechanic, giving them limited real-world time to make decisions before guards would discover their hiding spot. After considering options like the abandoned church or trying to scale the city wall, they decided to find a way out of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They stealthily navigated the streets, eventually reaching the city's outer wall. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], using his Mold Earth cantrip, tunneled under the 5-10 foot thick wall, creating a passage for the group. They emerged outside the city, unseen, near a pair of colossal statues overlooking the ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

[[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to wear a uniform instead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s ink-stained cloak and wore it inside out for disguise. The party then staged the scene with the unconscious guards: [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] arranged them to look as if they were spooning naked under a blanket made of dirt (courtesy of Mold Earth), with their faces clear to breathe. He also dripped a trail of oil from their location back towards the fuel storage building to create a misleading narrative. Having neutralized the immediate threat and created a diversion, the party took a short rest. Their new plan was to have [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] don the guard outfits and escort [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] (as a prisoner) and the cloaked [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (trailing behind) towards one of the city gates, ostensibly heading for the prison, then find an opportunity to slip out of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] entirely.                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] jokingly suggested finding and killing a baby [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] inquired about the distance to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], the capital, which the DM stated was a three-hour journey. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then approached a "fat drunk dude" in the guild hall to ask for transport. The man, after some confusing dialogue about carts being parked outside because they didn't fit inside the room, eventually made it clear the carts were simply outside the building. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] confirmed finding carts outside. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then feigned having forgotten where he parked his own cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] questioned the DM about currency inflation due to time travel. The DM decided to simplify by multiplying the party's current gold by 2x, rather than scaling prices. The blacksmith, who eventually introduced himself as [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] after some prodding, offered the party a quest: deliver a newly finished one-handed sword to a wealthy benefactor in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. The benefactor was described as a "city folk" who would be by a fountain in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], wearing a red tunic and a "funny little hat with a little ball on top," which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] likened to Mickey Mouse. The benefactor was paying 1000 gold pieces for the sword. After some negotiation, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], with a successful persuasion check (boosted by the DM for a good speech involving "dingle" puns), secured a 15% cut (150 gold pieces) for the party to deliver the sword. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] warned them to return with 850 gold by noon the next day or face consequences from the Blacksmith's Guild. The party confirmed the deal. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party went outside to find a cart. A stable dude informed them the carts were not for sale or rent. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted to claim one by pretending to be the supposed owner, but the stable dude wasn't fooled. The real owner, an old man with a tuft of hair named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], appeared. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then tried to persuade [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] to allow them use of his transportation to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], since he lived there. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also attempted to persuade him, suggesting he could do mobile sales. After a successful persuasion check from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (19), [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] agreed to let them use his cart, which would be driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, along with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], began the remaining hour-long walk to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], taking the main path. They arrived at the gates of the city without further incident. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] confirmed with the DM that the city was still called [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], implying the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] bloodline still ruled. The session ended here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
