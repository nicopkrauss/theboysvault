# Faaltan Mountains
## Overview
The [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Faaltan Mountains\|Faaltan Mountains]] form a jagged wall of stone and shadow along Cirano’s eastern frontier. Ancient and inhospitable, these peaks are sparsely wooded and often cloaked in fog. Few paths run deep into the range, and those that do are rarely walked twice. Soldiers stationed in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] keep watch over the pass, and even hardened miners rarely stray far from the valley mouth.

Rumors persist of strange lights, hollow echoes, and figures glimpsed on high ridges. Locals speak of a group known only as **[[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]**, said to dwell deep within the mountains—though most wisely avoid asking questions.
