# Heartforge
## Overview
The **Heartforge** is a sprawling subterranean complex hidden deep within the Faaltan Mountains. Once the stronghold of the enigmatic **Shardbinders**, the site is now little more than ruin and myth. Dwarven stonework runs through every corridor and chamber, though it’s clear the cult expanded the space for their own purposes.  
While few know the location, those who do dare not enter. The brave—or foolish—seek the Heartforge in pursuit of ancient relics, for it is said to contain **powerful artifacts sealed away beyond mortal reach**.

## History
The [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] was never a city, nor a kingdom—it was a **temple-fortress**. Constructed by an unknown dwarven sect and later overtaken by [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], it became a central hub for the cult’s and their most dangerous work.  
Believing the world’s most powerful relics were born from the destruction of the gods, the Shardbinders gathered here to house and protect the artifacts they unearthed—or to guard them from others.

Though they were still believed to inhabit the Heartforge, it would appear no one has lived in these ruins for decades.
