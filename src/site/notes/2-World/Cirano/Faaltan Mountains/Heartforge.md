# Heartforge
## Overview
The **Heartforge** is a sprawling subterranean complex hidden deep within the Faaltan Mountains. Once the stronghold of the enigmatic **Shardbinders**, the site is now little more than ruin and myth. Dwarven stonework runs through every corridor and chamber, though it’s clear the cult expanded the space for their own purposes.  
While few know the location, those who do dare not enter. The brave—or foolish—seek the Heartforge in pursuit of ancient relics, for it is said to contain **powerful artifacts sealed away beyond mortal reach**.

## History
The [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] was never a city, nor a kingdom—it was a **temple-fortress**. Constructed by an unknown dwarven sect and later overtaken by [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], it became a central hub for the cult’s and their most dangerous work.  
Believing the world’s most powerful relics were born from the destruction of the gods, the Shardbinders gathered here to house and protect the artifacts they unearthed—or to guard them from others.

Though they were still believed to inhabit the Heartforge, it would appear no one has lived in these ruins for decades.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | After the colossus fight, the party explored the immediate area, finding skeletons yielding a health potion and gold coins taken by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises. They took a long rest, leveled up to 3, and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] gave [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] he found to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. Following a magical compass, they arrived at the entrance to the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], an ancient temple fortress overtaken by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], identified through a successful History check on their shattered heart symbol. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | Inside the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], the party encountered a bridge over lava with pressure plates. They deciphered a cryptic message on the wall reading "Do not trust it." After some trial and error involving fire traps triggered by stepping on incorrect plates ([[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] took some damage), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] discovered a safe path using his shield to block the flames. The party then used [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s teleportation ability (via his turtle familiar) to get everyone across safely, but the party had to go back to unlock the door.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | With the second artifact secured, the compass led the party out of the brazier room and through the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] ruins to another large door flanked by stag statues and overgrown with thick, magical vines. Initial attempts to force the door open, even with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]’s strength (despite high rolls and Guidance), failed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s high perception roll revealed water dripping from the ceiling made the vines pulse. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] discovered that applying water caused the vines to rapidly grow, eventually forcing the door open from the inside. The session ended as the party looked into the next chamber.                                                                            |
