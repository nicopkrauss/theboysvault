## Overview

## Additional Details
[[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] is ruled by **[[Lord Emric Thane\|Lord Emric Thane]]**, a fair and well-liked noble who oversees the town with a steady hand. The people live by the rhythms of the land—rising early to tend crops, trading in the modest market square, and gathering communally during seasonal milestones. The Sun Salutation features vibrant colors, local music, and fields adorned with wreaths of grain and wildflowers. While it lacks formal shops or enchantments, Prin’s produce is among the most prized in [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]].

> [!attention]+ The Fountain at the edge of town.
> Hidden near the edge of Prin’s farmland lies a sacred natural spring known only to locals: **the Shimmerwell**. Said to gleam faintly under moonlight, its waters are believed to bless the year’s crops with vigor and health. The townsfolk draw from it only once a year during the Sun Salutation, using it in a quiet ritual to bless the first harvested crops. Its location is kept secret from outsiders and protected with a blend of reverence, superstition, and generational trust.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical. |
