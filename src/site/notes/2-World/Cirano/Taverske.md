# Taverske
## Overview
[[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] stands as the kingdom's eastern bulwark, a watchpost nestled in the valley just before the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Faaltan Mountains\|Faaltan Mountains]]. Sparse trees line the outskirts, but the terrain quickly becomes harsh and rocky. The town is populated almost entirely by soldiers and miners, working in service of the monarchy to maintain order at the kingdom’s edge.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelian\|Dáelian]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.                                                                           |
