# Taverske
## Overview
[[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] stands as the kingdom's eastern bulwark, a watchpost nestled in the valley just before the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Faaltan Mountains\|Faaltan Mountains]]. Sparse trees line the outskirts, but the terrain quickly becomes harsh and rocky. The town is populated almost entirely by soldiers and miners, working in service of the monarchy to maintain order at the kingdom’s edge.

| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party located the [[Apple Inn\|Apple Inn]], a nicer establishment run by a younger version of [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. They inquired about rooms, which cost five gold per night, with options for multiple occupants. The DM noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Jared's character) was not currently with the party, showing a brief flashback to him at the blacksmith's guild, earning gold by being slapped. The party discussed potential investments with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who suggested the local bank. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then brought up the [[Shardbinders\|Shardbinders]]. Tim revealed they were a notorious cult operating from the mountains, with [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] serving as a military outpost against them. He mentioned their long history of terrorizing the region and frequent, albeit often unsuccessful, campaigns against them. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] also asked about their sword buyer, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. Tim recognized Dingle as an old friend and a regular at the inn, known for his many female companions. Tim suggested the "majesty fountain" in the city courtyard as the most likely meeting place for Dingle.                                                                                                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party debated how to approach [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], deciding to take the cart back but feigning ignorance about his betrayal. They returned to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] (now 2 PM) and found the disgruntled carriage driver. After some haggling and intimidation, they paid him part of the fee (25 gold) plus a bonus (15 gold) to take the "scenic route," allowing them a long rest during the 8-hour journey. During the ride, they learned from the driver that Tim Apple was feared, had branded the driver for interrupting him (with the Shardbinder symbol), and that others had been transported to the area recently (including the bandits they just fought). The driver dropped them off not in the city, but at a ruined blacksmiths' guild outside it, where Tim Apple was waiting. Tim led them inside, recounting the guild's history, before descending stairs into a vast chamber below. There, Tim revealed his true form – [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], a Shardbinder who survived the "god's death" – and demanded the artifacts. The party refused. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] began drawing power from the relics, the room shook, and Shardbinder reinforcements appeared as initiative was rolled for the final confrontation. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party boards a carriage, stopping briefly in the farming town of [[2-World/Cirano/Prin\|Prin]] where [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] retrieves supplies (and 17 gold) from his family. The party intimidates the carriage driver into waiting for their return and taking them back to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They arrive in [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]]. Following the compass, they venture into the forest, where they discover a glowing sword embedded in a tree. This triggers an ambush by bandits, leading to a chaotic battle. The party defeats the bandits, loots 45 gold, and discovers the sword is nonmagical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
