"traits":
- "desc": "The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6\
    \ to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
    \ [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [stone shape](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md),\
    \ [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer\
    \ duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day each: [conjure\
    \ elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([earth elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md)\
    \ only), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md),\
    \ [phantasmal killer](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-killer.md), [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md),\
    \ [wall of stone](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md)\n\n3/day each:\
    \ [passwall](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md), [move earth](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/move-earth.md),\
    \ [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
    \ (mightier genies only; see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While\
    \ doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through."

    \ behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"

    \ effects that would knock it [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
  "name": "Sure-Footed"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
    \ spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal.\
    \ Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell\
    \ on other creatures and objects as well."

    \ (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
