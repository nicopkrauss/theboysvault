- "desc": "The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6\
    \ to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
    \ [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [stone shape](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md)\n\
    \n1/day each: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md)\
    \ ([earth elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) only),\
    \ [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md),\
    \ [phantasmal killer](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-killer.md), [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md),\
    \ [wall of stone](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md)\n\n3/day each:\
    \ [passwall](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md), [move earth](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/move-earth.md),\
    \ [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While\
    \ doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through."
  "name": "Earth Glide"
- "desc": "If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against\
    \ effects that would knock it [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
  "name": "Sure-Footed"
- "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most\
    \ potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie\
    \ that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a\
    \ genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again\
    \ for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same\
    \ genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that\
    \ creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of\
    \ the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the [wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md)\
    \ spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's\
    \ nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting\
    \ the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to\
    \ be to the genie's benefit."

"actions":
- "desc": "The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15\

  "name": "Fist"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20\
    \ (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
