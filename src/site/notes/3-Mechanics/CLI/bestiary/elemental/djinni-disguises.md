- "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
    \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
    \ requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
    \ [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md),\
    \ [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer\
    \ duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day each: [conjure\
    \ elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([air elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md)\
    \ only), [creation](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/creation.md), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md),\
    \ [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [major image](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md),\
    \ [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)\n\n3/day each: [create\
    \ food and water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md) (can create\
    \ wine instead of water), [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [wind\
    \ walk](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wind-walk.md), [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
    \ (mightier genies only; see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
    \ spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal.\
    \ Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell\
    \ on other creatures and objects as well."
  "name": "Disguises"
"actions":
- "desc": "The djinni makes three scimitar attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12\
    \ (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's\
    \ choice)."
  "name": "Scimitar"
- "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
    \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
    \ long as the djinni maintains [concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
    \ (as if [concentrating](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on\
    \ a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed\
    \ on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures\
    \ [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind\
    \ move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature\
    \ can use its action to free a creature [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.\
    \ If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
