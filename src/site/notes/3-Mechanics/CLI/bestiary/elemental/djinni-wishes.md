- "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
    \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
    \ requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
    \ [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md)\n\
    \n1/day each: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md)\
    \ ([air elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) only),\
    \ [creation](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/creation.md), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md),\
    \ [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [major image](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md),\
    \ [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)\n\n3/day each: [create\
    \ food and water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md) (can create\
    \ wine instead of water), [tongues](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [wind\
    \ walk](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wind-walk.md)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most\
    \ potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie\
    \ that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a\
    \ genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again\
    \ for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same\
    \ genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that\
    \ creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of\
    \ the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the [wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md)\
    \ spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's\
    \ nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting\
    \ the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to\
    \ be to the genie's benefit."
  "name": "Wishes"
"actions":
- "desc": "The djinni makes three scimitar attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12\
    \ (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's\
    \ choice)."
  "name": "Scimitar"
- "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
    \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
    \ long as the djinni maintains [concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
    \ (as if [concentrating](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on\
    \ a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed\
    \ on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures\
    \ [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind\
    \ move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature\
    \ can use its action to free a creature [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.\
    \ If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
