- "desc": "The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16,\
    \ +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
    \ requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [create or destroy water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md),\
    \ [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect\
    \ magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [fog cloud](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md),\

    \ self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer duration\
    \ than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day each: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md)\
    \ ([water elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) only),\
    \ [control water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-water.md), [gaseous form](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md),\

  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The marid can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam,\
    \ leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
    \ spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal.\
    \ Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell\
    \ on other creatures and objects as well."

    \ damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack."
  "name": "Trident"
- "desc": "The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,\
    \ a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller,\
    \ is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed\
    \ nor knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
