- "desc": "The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16,\
    \ +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
    \ requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [create or destroy water](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md),\
    \ [detect evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect\

    1/day each: [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md)\

  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The marid can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam,\
    \ leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most\
    \ potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie\
    \ that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a\
    \ genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again\
    \ for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same\
    \ genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that\
    \ creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of\
    \ the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the [wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md)\
    \ spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's\
    \ nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting\
    \ the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to\
    \ be to the genie's benefit."

- "desc": "The marid makes two trident attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60\

    \ damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack."
  "name": "Trident"
- "desc": "The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,\
    \ a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller,\
    \ is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed\
    \ nor knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
