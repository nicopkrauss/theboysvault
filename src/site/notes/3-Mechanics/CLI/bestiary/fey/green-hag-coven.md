- "desc": "While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another,\
    \ they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must\
    \ share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n1st level (4 slots): [identify](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md),\
    \ [ray of sickness](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ray-of-sickness.md)\n\n2nd level\
    \ (3 slots): [hold person](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md), [locate object](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-object.md)\n\

    \n6th level (1 slots): [eyebite](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eyebite.md)\n\nFor\

    \ as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC 13, and the spell attack bonus\
    \ is +5."
  "name": "Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)"
- "desc": "The hag can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears\
    \ the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight))\

    \ (2d8 + 4) slashing damage."
  "name": "Claws"
- "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical\
    \ illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid\
    \ shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she\
    \ dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection.\
    \ For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching\
    \ her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to\
    \ visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check to discern that the hag is disguised."
  "name": "Illusory Appearance"
- "desc": "The hag magically turns [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
    \ until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her [concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
    \ ends (as if [concentrating](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
    \ on a spell). While [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible),\
    \ she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by\
    \ magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
    \ with her."
  "name": "Invisible Passage"
"lair_actions":
- "desc": "The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties.\
    \ Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one\
    \ (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires\
    \ a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful\
    \ ability."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair\
    \ action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect\
    \ two rounds in a row:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through\
    \ solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there. \
    \ \n- The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing\
    \ each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically\
    \ locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she\
    \ chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open\
    \ them.  "
  "name": ""
- "desc": "A powerful green hag might have the following additional lair action:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its\
    \ own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance\
    \ equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no\
    \ action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't\
    \ take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick\
    \ up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears\
    \ if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses\
    \ it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action\
    \ to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects\
    \ in its possession.  "
  "name": ""
"regional_effects":
- "desc": "Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home\
    \ of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a\
    \ single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect\
    \ that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's\
    \ most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies\
    \ or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's\
    \ fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate\
    \ to the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence\
    \ score of 2 or lower are [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n-\
    \ Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.\
    \  "
  "name": ""
- "desc": "A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional\
    \ effects within 1 mile of her lair:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times\
    \ (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no\
    \ substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when\
    \ one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with\
    \ them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory\
    \ duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.  \n- The region takes twice as long\
    \ as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps\
    \ are thick with reeking mud.  \n- Trees transform into [awakened trees](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md)\
    \ and attack when hostile intruders are near.  "
