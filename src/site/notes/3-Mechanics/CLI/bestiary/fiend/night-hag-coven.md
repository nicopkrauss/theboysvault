  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another,\
    \ they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must\
    \ share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n1st level (4 slots): [identify](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md),\

    \ is +7."
  "name": "Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)"
- "desc": "The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical\
    \ effects."
  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself.\
    \ If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve\
    \ it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.\n\nHeartstone: This lustrous\
    \ black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession.\
    \ The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes\
    \ 30 days.\n\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's\
    \ Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched\
    \ flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night\
    \ hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes\
    \ 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag)."
  "name": "Night Hag Items"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13\
    \ (2d8 + 4) slashing damage."
  "name": "Claws (Hag Form Only)"
- "desc": "The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or\
    \ back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment\
    \ she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if\
    \ she dies."
  "name": "Change Shape"
- "desc": "The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or\
    \ vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession."
  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid\
    \ on the Material Plane. A [protection from evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long\
    \ as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last\
    \ for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit\
    \ point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's\
    \ hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul\
    \ is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum\
    \ lasts until removed by the  [greater restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or similar magic."

"lair_actions":
- "desc": "The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties.\
    \ Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one\
    \ (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires\
    \ a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful\
    \ ability."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair\
    \ action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect\
    \ two rounds in a row:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through\
    \ solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there. \
    \ \n- The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing\
    \ each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically\
    \ locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she\
    \ chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open\
    \ them.  "
  "name": ""
- "desc": "A powerful night hag might have the following additional lair actions:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- One creature the hag can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a\
    \ DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape,\
    \ the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the hag's.\
    \ If the creature wins, it escapes the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends on\
    \ initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears\
    \ in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.\
    \  \n- The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see within 60 feet of\
    \ her. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be flung\
    \ up to 30 feet through the air. A creature that strikes a solid object or is\
    \ released in midair takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved or\
    \ fallen.  "
  "name": ""
"regional_effects":
- "desc": "Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home\
    \ of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a\
    \ single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect\
    \ that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's\
    \ most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies\
    \ or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's\
    \ fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:"

    \ by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n-\
    \ Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.\

    \ alive.  \n- Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled\
    \ with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, and cackling. The creatures are trapped there\
    \ for a minute or two, and then returned to the place where they vanished from.\
    \  \n- Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members,\
    \ and even themselves littering the hag's realm. Any attempt to interact with\
    \ a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.  "
