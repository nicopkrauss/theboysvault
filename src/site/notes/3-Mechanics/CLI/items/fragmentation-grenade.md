# Fragmentation Grenade
*Explosive*  


- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the character can propel the grenade up to 120 feet away.

Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding fragmentation grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
