# Goggles of Night
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/goggles-of-night.webp#right)


While wearing these dark lenses, you have [darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
