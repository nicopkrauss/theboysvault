# Horn of Valhalla, Iron
*Wondrous item, major, legendary*  


- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the [berserker](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) statistics. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The iron horn summons `5d4 + 5` [berserkers](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md). To use the iron horn, you must be proficient with all martial weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [berserkers](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
