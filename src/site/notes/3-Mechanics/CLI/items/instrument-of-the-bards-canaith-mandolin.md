# Instrument of the Bards, Canaith Mandolin
*Wondrous item, instrument, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md), [invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

In addition, the Canaith mandolin can be used to cast [cure wounds](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md) (3rd level), [dispel magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), and [protection from energy](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-energy.md) (lightning only).
