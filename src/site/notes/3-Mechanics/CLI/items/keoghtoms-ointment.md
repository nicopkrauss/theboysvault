# Keoghtom's Ointment
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/keoghtoms-ointment.webp#right)


This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `1d4 + 1` doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh Â½ pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains `2d8 + 2` hit points, ceases to be [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), and is cured of any disease.
