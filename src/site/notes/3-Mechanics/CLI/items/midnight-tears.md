# Midnight Tears
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 1,500 gp

A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (`9d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
