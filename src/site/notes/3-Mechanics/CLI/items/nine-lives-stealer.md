# Nine Lives Stealer
*Major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/nine-lives-stealer.webp#right)


You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The sword has `1d8 + 1` charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
