# Potion of Poison
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  



This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [potion of healing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [identify](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md) spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take `3d6` poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). At the start of each of your turns while you are [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, you take `3d6` poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by `1d6`. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
