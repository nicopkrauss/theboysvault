# Ring of X-ray Vision
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-x-ray-vision.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).
