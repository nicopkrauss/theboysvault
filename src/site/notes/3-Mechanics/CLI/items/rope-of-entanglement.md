# Rope of Entanglement
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rope-of-entanglement.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
