- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

## Curse

This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
