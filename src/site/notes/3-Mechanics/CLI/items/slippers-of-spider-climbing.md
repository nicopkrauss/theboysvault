# Slippers of Spider Climbing
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/slippers-of-spider-climbing.webp#right)


While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
