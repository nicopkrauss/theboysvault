# Truth Serum
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 150 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. The [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a [zone of truth](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell.
