# Universal Solvent
*Wondrous item, minor, legendary*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/universal-solvent.webp#right)


This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including [sovereign glue](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sovereign-glue.md).
