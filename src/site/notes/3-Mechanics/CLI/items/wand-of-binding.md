# Wand of Binding
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-binding.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

## Spells

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [hold monster](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster.md) (5 charges) or [hold person](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md) (2 charges).

## Assisted Escape

While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
