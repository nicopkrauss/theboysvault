# Wand of Fear
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-fear.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

## Command

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the [command](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/command.md) spell (save DC 15).

## Cone of Fear

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand's tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. While it is [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the [Dash](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action or try to escape from an effect that prevent it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the [Dodge](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
