# Wand of Secrets
*Wand, minor, uncommon*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-secrets.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges, and if a secret door or trap is within 30 feet of you, the wand pulses and points at the one nearest to you. The wand regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
