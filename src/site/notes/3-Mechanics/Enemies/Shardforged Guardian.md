# Shardforged Guardian

> _"It does not breathe. It does not speak. It waits, buried in silence and stone, for the day its master's will is fulfilled—or for the next fool to try."_

The Shardforged Guardian is a relic of a forgotten age—an artificial sentinel shaped from stone, crystal, and fragments of lost titans. These constructs were once crafted by ancient cults and fallen kingdoms to guard sacred shrines, powerful artifacts, and forbidden knowledge. Though their creators are long gone, many guardians still stir to life when their sanctums are disturbed.

## Ancient Relic Wardens

Shardforged Guardians are most often found in ruinous temples, overgrown shrines, or buried sanctuaries—places where the echoes of the old world remain strong. Some guard objects of immense magical power, while others stand sentinel over empty halls, their original purpose lost to time.

Their crystal cores still hum faintly with stored energy, reacting to the presence of certain relics or divine shards. In rare cases, a Guardian might even awaken when a particular individual enters its domain—one marked by destiny, or by blood.

## Crystalline Intelligence

Though not intelligent in a traditional sense, Shardforged Guardians possess a limited tactical awareness. They will hide, stalk, or remain motionless for days or years, striking only when a target enters the sanctum or disturbs a protected object. Their shard-infused bodies allow them to blend into ruined environments, moving with surprising speed and stealth for creatures of their size.
## Echoes of the Titans

The shards embedded in a Guardian’s form are more than decoration—they are remnants of the Primal Titans’ shattered hearts. These crystalline splinters grant the construct resistance to certain magics and allow it to unleash brief flashes of force or slashing energy in battle. Some theorists believe these shards could still “remember” pieces of their titan origin, and that the Guardians might act not merely as protectors, but as witnesses of a bygone age.
