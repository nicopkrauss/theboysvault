# Atavista Royal Family
## Overview
The Atavista Royal Family, formally known as **House Atavistos**, has ruled the province of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] since 254 AG, when they overthrew the dwarven-only regime of the Krankel Clan. The family’s rise to power marked a historic turning point for the region—ushering in a new era of unity between dwarves and humans. They renamed the capital to Atavista, after themselves, and established a firm but inclusive monarchy.

House Atavistos governs directly, with authority over all of Cirano's cities, towns, and trade routes. Though other noble families exist, none hold sway equal to that of the royal house. The family is both politically and symbolically central to Cirano's identity, and their presence is felt in every facet of daily life, from military law to the structuring of holidays.

The current monarch, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]], is a young warrior-king of 27 years. He is seen by some as unproven, particularly among the lower classes who still remember the famine that struck early in his reign. Nevertheless, he is an active ruler, trained in battle and governance, with ambitions to strengthen Cirano’s defenses and regional alliances.

## Etymology
The name _Atavistos_ predates the family’s rise to power and is believed to have originated during their time as a prominent guild of blacksmiths. Though its exact roots are unknown, many scholars believe it to be a compound of ancient dwarvish and old common—possibly meaning _"those who endure through flame."_ The name reflects both their craftsmanship and their resilience under the oppressive rule of the Krankel Clan.

## Activities
The royal family oversees governance, diplomacy, taxation, and the armed forces of Cirano. They hold court regularly in Atavista and are directly involved in settling disputes, ratifying trade, and maintaining roads, bridges, and infrastructure. The king also commands the [[Royal Knights of Atavista\|Royal Knights of Atavista]], an elite martial order loyal only to the crown.

When the Atavistos guild led a successful uprising in 254 AG and seized the city from dwarven control, they renamed the capital [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] in their own honor. The **Festival of Hadron**, named after their founder and first king, is celebrated annually to mark this turning point in Cirano’s history.

## Culture
The [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Atavista Royal Family\|Atavista Royal Family]] is known for its wealth, prestige, and visible power. The royal palace in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] is one of the most magnificent on the continent—designed to impress, intimidate, and remind all who visit of the family’s dominance. Opulence is not hidden but proudly displayed through art, architecture, and lavish ceremony.

## History
House Atavistos rose to power in 254 AG following the ousting of the Krankel dwarves—an insular regime that restricted citizenship and leadership to dwarves alone. Led by [[King Hadron Atavistos\|King Hadron Atavistos]], the uprising united humans and sympathetic dwarves under a single banner. After a decisive victory and a public oath to unify the realm, Hadron was crowned king and renamed the capital **Atavista**.

Since then, the royal family has held unbroken power in Cirano. Each king or queen has ruled with active involvement in state affairs, maintaining both stability and tradition. The Atavistos line has weathered conflict, famine, and political unrest—and yet their crown still holds.
