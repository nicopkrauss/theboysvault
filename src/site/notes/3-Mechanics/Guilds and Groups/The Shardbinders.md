# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
**`=this.file.name`** are a secretive but widely whispered-about cult, known to dwell deep within the forbidding [[Faaltan Mountains]]. Though relatively small—around 500 members—their influence far exceeds their numbers. Their purpose is nothing less than **reassembling the shattered power of the Primal Titans**, whose crystalline hearts became the magical shards scattered throughout the world. They believe these relics were created in a violent act of godlike ambition and that their leader is destined to complete that work. Locals avoid the mountains not out of superstition, but because those who venture too close often do not return.
