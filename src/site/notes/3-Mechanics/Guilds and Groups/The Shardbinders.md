# The Shardbinders
## Overview
**The Shardbinders** are a secretive but widely whispered-about cult, known to dwell deep within the forbidding [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Faaltan Mountains\|Faaltan Mountains]]. Though relatively small—around 500 members—their influence far exceeds their numbers. Their purpose is nothing less than **reassembling the shattered power of the Primal Titans**, whose crystalline hearts became the magical shards scattered throughout the world. They believe these relics were created in a violent act of godlike ambition and that their leader is destined to complete that work. Locals avoid the mountains not out of superstition, but because those who venture too close often do not return.

## Etymology
The name _Shardbinders_ was chosen by the cult to reflect their divine mission. “Shards” are the crystallized fragments of the hearts of the **Five Primal Titans**, torn out by the dark titan **Faal** in a catastrophic ritual. “Binding” refers to the act of collecting and unifying these scattered relics, a sacred process believed to restore the power Faal unleashed—power that their leader now seeks to wield.

## Activities
The Shardbinders stop at nothing to locate and retrieve shard-bearing relics, which they view as sacred remnants of a long-lost divine order. Whether buried in ancient ruins, locked in royal vaults, or carried by unsuspecting adventurers, no shard is too well-guarded. They strike surgically—through theft, assassination, or arcane sabotage—and vanish just as quickly. They do not negotiate. Many among them are skilled mages trained to interact with and protect the shards they recover.

## Society
### Beliefs
The Shardbinders believe that the titan **Faal**, through a ritual of dark magic, tore the hearts from the **Five Primal Titans**—gods of elemental and cosmic force. The hearts crystalized instantly into powerful shards, and the backlash annihilated Faal himself. These shards, scattered across the world, are the source of immense power. The cult believes that collecting and binding them will allow their leader to complete Faal’s work and ascend beyond mortal limits.

### Culture
The Shardbinders maintain a disciplined and orderly aesthetic. They wear deep **purple robes** adorned with their emblem: **five glowing shards drawn toward a single central point**, symbolizing both unity and power. They reside in structured, carved chambers within the **Faaltan Mountains**, more monastic than militant in design. Rituals, training, and study are conducted in silence and with purpose. Every member, from recruit to Shardbearer, carries themselves with calm precision—driven by the shared belief that their cause is inevitable.

## Possessions
> [!attention]+ Relic acquired
> The Shardbinders have successfully fused several shards into a single, completed relic: a **deep violet jewel** set into an unassuming **silver ring**. Though elegant in appearance, the gem hums with immense magical energy. It grants the wearer various Chameleon abilities. The relic is worn exclusively by the Shardbinder himself, allowing him to operate undetected in the world beyond the Faaltan Mountains. It is their first success—and proof that binding the shards truly unlocks divine potential.

## History
> [!attention]+ Founding of the Shardbinders
> The Shardbinders were founded in the shadow of the **Gathering**, though no one alive knows the exact year. Their creation was the work of [Gul'Roth](app://obsidian.md/Gul'Roth), the last surviving god. In the aftermath of Silvanaar’s divine purge, [Gul'Roth](app://obsidian.md/Gul'Roth) secretly gathered enough shards to forge a relic of his own: one formed from the heart of the slain titan **Filandir**. With it, he cloaked himself in mortal identity and vanished from the myths. The Shardbinders were born as his instrument—devoted to reclaiming the lost shards, unaware that their **founder walks among them**, still orchestrating their every move.

| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | After the colossus fight, the party explored the immediate area, finding skeletons yielding a health potion and gold coins taken by [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. They decided to enter the ruins they unlocked by defeating the colossus. They located a storage room containing rations, torches, and cultist robes, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]], and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] donned as disguises. They took a long rest, leveled up to 3, and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] gave [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Caelindir’s Step\|Caelindir’s Step]] he found to [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. Following a magical compass, they arrived at the entrance to the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]], an ancient temple fortress overtaken by the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]], identified through a successful History check on their shattered heart symbol. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-13-2025\|04-13-2025]] | Upon crossing the bridge, the doors opened into a chamber containing the next artifact, [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]], protected by a barrier and four flaming braziers. Extinguishing the braziers (using [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Create Water spell and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] smothering one with his shield) dropped the barrier but also opened hidden crypts, releasing numerous [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]] skeletons. The party engaged in combat, with [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam dealing significant area damage and [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (using his Giant's Might) delivering heavy blows, quickly dispatching the undead. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] claimed the [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Viremyr's Mittens\|Viremyr's Mittens]].                                                                             |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                   |
