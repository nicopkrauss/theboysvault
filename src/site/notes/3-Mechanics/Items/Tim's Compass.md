# Tim's Compass
*Magical Compass*

This compass was given to the party by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]] to aid in the retrieval of six powerful artifacts. It does not point north or react to conventional geography. Instead, it orients toward something far more mysterious—**an unknown source of power**. The device emits a faint, rhythmic hum as the star pulses with light, and the vapor above it stretches and curls, always drifting toward the artifact it seeks, regardless of where the user stands.

Though its origins are unknown, the craftsmanship is flawless, and its enchantments unmistakable. Subtle threads of divination and tracking magic are woven into its form, suggesting it was built for a singular, focused purpose—and built well.

- **Weight**: 0.2 lbs.
