#### **Echo Crash (Passive)**
When you score a **critical hit with a melee weapon**, all creatures within 5 feet of your target take **1d6 force damage** as a resonant shockwave ripples outward.

#### **Overcrush (Passive)**
When you make a melee attack and **exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more**, the attack deals **an additional die of weapon damage**.

#### **Earthen Rebirth (1/long rest)**
When reduced to **0 hit points**, you erupt in a surge of earth and stone. You immediately regain **2d10 + your Constitution modifier** hit points and **stand up automatically**.

You enter a **Rebirth State** that lasts **2 turns** (until the end of your next turn). While in this state:

- You have **resistance to all damage**
    
- Your melee attacks deal an extra **1d6 force damage**
    
- You have **advantage on Strength checks and saving throws**

At the end of the second turn, you **immediately fall unconscious with 0 HP** and begin making death saving throws as normal.

## **Description**
This enormous, rune-inscribed chestplate is infused with the ancient power of the Primal [[Titan of Earth, Eskaro\|Titan of Earth, Eskaro]]. Forged from volcanic stone and giantsteel, the armor hums with the silent weight of mountains. A volatile magma gemstone is embedded in the center of the chest, veined with flowing lava that pulses with every footstep.

It is said that the Bulwark does not merely protect its bearer—it **reshapes the battlefield around them**, punishing the weak and echoing the wrath of the deep earth.
