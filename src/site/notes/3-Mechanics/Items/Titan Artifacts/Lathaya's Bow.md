#### **Everdrawn (Passive)**
The bow never requires ammunition. Arrows made of pure air form when you nock the string.

#### **Flurry Volley (1/short rest)**
As an action, you make three ranged attacks with disadvantage. Each attack must target a different creature within 75 feet.

#### **Twisting Shot (1/short rest)**
Your next attack with Lathaya’s Bow ignores all cover and does not require line of sight. The arrow bends around obstacles, guided by currents of wind.

#### **Lathaya’s Warning (3/long rest)**
When a creature makes an attack roll, you may use your reaction to fire a preemptive shot. If the attack hits, the target must roll to hit again (disadvantage).

## **Description**
This elegant longbow is formed from a single sweeping curve of bleached antler and living wood, twined with ivy that never withers. Runes of old wind-speech spiral down the limbs, glowing faintly when drawn. A shard of the [[Titan of Wind, Lathaya\|Titan of Wind, Lathaya]] pulses at its heart—unseen, but felt in every gust that swirls around the wielder.

Legends say Lathaya was the first breath of the world, and when her heart shattered, a single sliver embedded itself in the branch of a tree that had never touched soil. This is the bow made from that impossible branch.
