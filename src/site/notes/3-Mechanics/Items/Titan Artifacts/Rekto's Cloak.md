## Description
This storm-dark cloak is cut from the essence of a shard torn from [[Titan of War, Rekto\|Titan of War, Rekto]]. Its heavy folds ripple with invisible pressure, as if resisting the pull of the very earth. A fractured crimson gemstone is embedded at the clasp, its jagged edges veined with silvery force-lines that glow faintly in the presence of bloodshed.

It is said the cloak remembers every battle it has witnessedâ€”each footstep echoes like a war drum, each motion carries the weight of unyielding purpose. When worn, the bearer walks not alone, but with the silent fury of a fallen god at their back.
