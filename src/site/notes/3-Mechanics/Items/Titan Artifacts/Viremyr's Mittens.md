## Description
Infused by [[Titan of Flame, Viremyr\|Titan of Flame, Viremyr]], these blackened gloves shimmer with threads of gold, bound from wrist to forearm by layered, ember-red wraps reminiscent of molten ribbons. Faint ember-veins pulse with intense heat through the fingers like rivers of magma. The wraps themselves twist and coil, radiating a smoldering glow that betrays the gauntlets’ fiery origin.
