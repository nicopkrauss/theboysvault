| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party went outside to find a cart. A stable dude informed them the carts were not for sale or rent. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted to claim one by pretending to be the supposed owner, but the stable dude wasn't fooled. The real owner, an old man with a tuft of hair named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], appeared. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then tried to persuade [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] to allow them use of his transportation to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], since he lived there. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also attempted to persuade him, suggesting he could do mobile sales. After a successful persuasion check from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (19), [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] agreed to let them use his cart, which would be driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, including [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], boarded [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s cart, driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the bandit captain's blood-soaked studded leather helmet as a souvenir. The party searched the bodies. They found 70 gold pieces, seven gems (two eye agate, three lapis lazuli, two malachite), one potion of healing, eleven scimitars, eleven light crossbows, one rapier, forty crossbow bolts, one set of thieves' tools, and a small keg of pork from the bandits' nearby camp. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] took the gems and one scimitar. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the potion of healing and the helmet. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] took the rapier and the thieves' tools. The party decided to burn the bodies and disregarded items in a bonfire off the trail, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] handling the pyrotechnics. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] emerged from the cart, distressed about his dead horse (named Friday). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], now out of a job as the cart driver, also expressed concern. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially argued they saved [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s life, but [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to pay 50 gold (25 each to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]) out of pocket for the trouble, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] contributed to. The payment was accepted, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] decided to accompany them, slinging his sledgehammer. |
