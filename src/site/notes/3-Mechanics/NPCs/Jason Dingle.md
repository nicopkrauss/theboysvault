| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party located the [[Apple Inn\|Apple Inn]], a nicer establishment run by a younger version of [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. They inquired about rooms, which cost five gold per night, with options for multiple occupants. The DM noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Jared's character) was not currently with the party, showing a brief flashback to him at the blacksmith's guild, earning gold by being slapped. The party discussed potential investments with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who suggested the local bank. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then brought up the [[Shardbinders\|Shardbinders]]. Tim revealed they were a notorious cult operating from the mountains, with [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] serving as a military outpost against them. He mentioned their long history of terrorizing the region and frequent, albeit often unsuccessful, campaigns against them. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] also asked about their sword buyer, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. Tim recognized Dingle as an old friend and a regular at the inn, known for his many female companions. Tim suggested the "majesty fountain" in the city courtyard as the most likely meeting place for Dingle. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] questioned the DM about currency inflation due to time travel. The DM decided to simplify by multiplying the party's current gold by 2x, rather than scaling prices. The blacksmith, who eventually introduced himself as [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] after some prodding, offered the party a quest: deliver a newly finished one-handed sword to a wealthy benefactor in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. The benefactor was described as a "city folk" who would be by a fountain in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], wearing a red tunic and a "funny little hat with a little ball on top," which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] likened to Mickey Mouse. The benefactor was paying 1000 gold pieces for the sword. After some negotiation, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], with a successful persuasion check (boosted by the DM for a good speech involving "dingle" puns), secured a 15% cut (150 gold pieces) for the party to deliver the sword. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] warned them to return with 850 gold by noon the next day or face consequences from the Blacksmith's Guild. The party confirmed the deal.                                          |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | Before leaving, it was noted that [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] the Tortle was paralyzed by fear since arriving at the guild, staring out a window and unresponsive, refusing to leave. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] decided to exploit this by charging onlookers one gold to "do whatever you want to this guy," assuring them [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] wouldn't flinch. A small child paid a gold piece and punched [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] in the face, dealing damage. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] encouraged more, and the child paid another gold for a second punch. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] humorously asked if the child was related to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]]. The child then ran off, and no one else took up [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, including [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], boarded [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s cart, driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
