# King Alondus Atavistos
## Profile

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]] is the current ruler of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista\|Atavista]], having ascended to the throne only five years ago after the unexpected death of his father, King Vaelric Atavistos, at the age of 52. At just 27 years old, Alondus is one of the youngest monarchs in the region, and while he rules actively and takes his duties seriously, many among the lower classes view him with quiet skepticism.

Three years into his reign, the kingdom suffered a harsh and unexpected drought, straining resources and eroding public trust. Though there was little Alondus could have done to prevent it, rumors linger. Some view him as inexperienced or unlucky—others say he has potential yet untapped.

Trained as a warrior from a young age, Alondus is often seen in public bearing ceremonial armor rather than robes of state. He is determined to prove himself—not just as a monarch, but as a protector of the realm.
