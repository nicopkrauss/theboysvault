| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The sudden appearance of [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]] and the defilement of the fountain drew immediate guard attention, with twenty guards quickly surrounding the party (excluding [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], who was dangling above). [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], after a brief attempt by [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] to climb and cut him down, used his Fey Step ability to teleport safely to the ground. The guards moved to arrest [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]]. Seizing the opportunity, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] used Misty Step to escape the guard encirclement. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and his dog, Sable, also managed to break free. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], finding himself the sole party member surrounded, attempted to reason with the guards but was informed he was being arrested for the fountain's desecration. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], now outside the circle, cast the Light cantrip on the inky fountain water, creating a flashbang effect that momentarily blinded all the guards. This allowed [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] to perform an acrobatic leap over the disoriented guards and rejoin the others. [[1-Party/Fain\|Fain]], whose escorting guard was distracted by the flash, turned invisible and also regrouped with the party. To cover their escape, [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], using his Giant's Might to become large, smashed a section of the fountain wall, causing a flood of inky water to surge towards the pursuing guards. The party, now all coated in black ink, fled the scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, including [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], boarded [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s cart, driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | Everyone rolled perception. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] was the only one to notice four "curious types" in studded leather armor by the side of the road, not hidden but not clearly armed yet. As the cart approached, one stepped into the road, and the horse stopped. The bandit announced it was his part of the forest and demanded a toll of 20 gold pieces. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted deception, claiming they had more mercenaries following, but failed. He then stepped off the cart to confront the bandit, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] growling menacingly. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] threatened the bandits. The lead bandit snapped his fingers, and eight more bandits emerged from the trees. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] readied a flame, and [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] readied an air arrow. The bandits' archers drew their arrows. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], getting a nod from his companions, punched the lead bandit in the face, initiating combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The battle began with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] landing a surprise punch on the lead bandit. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], utilizing Sharpshooter, quickly eliminated an enemy archer with a precise headshot. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] also engaged the bandit leader. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] focused on other melee attackers, with [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s Green Flame Blade arcing to a second foe. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then invoked Giant's Might, growing in size and unleashing a flurry of devastating attacks with his greatsword, felling several bandits in quick succession, including the one [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] had engaged. The cart driver, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], unexpectedly joined the fray, grabbing a sledgehammer and attacking the already wounded bandit captain. Despite some healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took several hits from the remaining bandits, including a nasty critical from the captain. However, the party's combined offense began to turn the tide. Archers exchanged fire, and tragically, the party's horse was shot and killed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] continued to pick off distant foes with his bow, including one particularly gruesome eyeball shot. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], using his monk speed, dashed to intercept a fleeing bandit, knocking him prone with a blast of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], a towering figure, continued his rampage, crushing one bandit's skull underfoot as he moved to engage others. He used an Action Surge to chain together more attacks, cleaving through the remaining bandits. The last few attempted to flee or fight, but were quickly dispatched by the party, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] finishing the final bandit by throwing his greatsword like a javelin. He then returned to his normal size. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attacks the large enemy ([[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]), rolling a 23 to hit and dealing 26 damage, plus an additional 9 fire damage from a fire rune, totaling 35 damage after resistances are considered. One of the cultists, described as a "healthist," moves forward. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Flurry Volley, attacking three different targets with disadvantage. He misses [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] but hits an unmarked cultist (8 damage) and an orange-marked cultist (12 damage). [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s companion, Sable (a dog), moves up and bites an unmarked cultist for 10 damage. A red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks the cultist casting Hold Person with a short sword, hitting for 12 damage after a Flurry of Blows. A green-marked cultist attacks Sable, dealing 3 damage. The red-marked cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] for 4 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (controlled by the DM) moves his previously cast Moonbeam. After a debate about how Moonbeam movement works, it's decided it can travel, hitting three cultists. One is obliterated, another takes some damage, and the third is virtually unscathed. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle companion then shoots a fireball, eviscerating the remaining cultist from that group. A blue-marked cultist moves to attack Sable but misses. An orange-marked cultist then attacks [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], dealing 6 damage. A cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] slashes him for 7 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

A cultist casts Command on [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], ordering him to "jump," but [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] succeeds on his Wisdom save. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots the blue-marked cultist for 12 damage. Sable attempts to bite the red-marked cultist but misses. The red-marked cultist attacks Sable but misses. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] heals himself for 16 HP and then misses an unarmed strike. The green-marked cultist attacks Sable, but [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses his reaction, Lathai's Warning, forcing the cultist to reroll with disadvantage, resulting in a miss. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves his Moonbeam again, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] (4 damage) and three cultists (8 damage each), killing one. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle kills another cultist with a flame attack. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Green Flame Blade, missing. She then uses Hex on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] as a bonus action, choosing Constitution for the disadvantage, and notes that her attacks will deal an extra 1d6 damage to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | A cultist near [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (referred to as Drew's character temporarily) casts Command ("swim") on [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], who succeeds on his Wisdom save. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes 3 fire damage from [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s rune. He then channels the artifacts, causing the ground to shake and split further, visually represented by the DM adjusting the map. The Moonbeam is clarified to be a 5-foot radius. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] then unleashes a wave of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] succeed on their Dexterity saves. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] fails her initial save but, after a debate about her position on a rock after teleporting, fails an Acrobatics check as well and takes 5 damage. Sable also fails and takes 5 damage. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] makes his Strength save to end [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s fire rune. He then fails his Constitution save against [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s Moonbeam (now with disadvantage from Hex) and takes damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves, avoiding lava and Moonbeam, but misses [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with an attack. He uses Gift of the Raven Queen to teleport. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] uses Hail of Thorns, hitting [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] for 9 damage, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] fails his Dexterity save against the thorns, taking an additional 5 damage. Sable dashes away from the danger. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] moves to Sable and uses Hands of Healing, restoring 6 HP to the dog. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] casts Ice Knife on [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], scoring a critical hit for 24 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] then uses his artifact ability, Avatar of Nature, gaining 10 temporary HP, +2 AC, and other benefits. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle attempts to retrieve [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]]'s lost chest plate from the lava and succeeds on its second attempt, handing it to [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast at [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], hitting for 6 damage (including Hex damage). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] takes Moonbeam damage. He then channels the artifacts, attempting to pull everyone in. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] succeed on their Strength checks. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (due to a natural 1) fail. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] uses his reaction to successfully catch [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] with a natural 20 Strength check, preventing him from being pulled. Sable is not pulled as he doesn't have an artifact. The floor splits again. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] moves behind [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] and attempts to grapple and suplex him into the lava. He rolls a natural 20 on his Athletics check. He slams [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s head into the lava, dealing 14 damage. The room then undoes some of the lava cracks. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] is now prone with his head in the lava.                                                                    |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots at the prone [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with disadvantage but misses. Sable attempts a bite attack but misses due to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s AC. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks with his longsword but misses, then hits with a bonus action unarmed strike for 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves the Moonbeam over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], who passes the save but still takes 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands. He performs a symbol and says, "Tata for now," disappearing in a puff of smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
