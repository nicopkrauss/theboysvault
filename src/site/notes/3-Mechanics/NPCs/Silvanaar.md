# Silvanaar
## Profile

[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Silvanaar\|Silvanaar]] is a figure wrapped in both legend and reverence, known as the mortal who ended the Age of Divinity. Though little is known of their origin, most agree that Silvanaar was once a scholar, warrior, or mystic who uncovered the scattered shards of the fallen titan [[Faal\|Faal]]'s heart. By uniting these fragments, they forged the mythic weapon [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Godrender\|Godrender]], a relic of such power it could unmake the divine.

With [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Godrender\|Godrender]] in hand, Silvanaar struck down the gods, one by one, during the event now known as the [[Gathering\|Gathering]]. This act ushered in the [[Age of Man\|Age of Man]], freeing mortals from divine ruleâ€”but at great cost. Silvanaar vanished the moment the final blow was struck. Neither their body nor the weapon has ever been found.

Some worship Silvanaar as a prophet or even a god in their own right. Others believe they died with the gods they slew. What remains undeniable is that Silvanaar reshaped history, not through armies or empires, but through one weapon and one will.
