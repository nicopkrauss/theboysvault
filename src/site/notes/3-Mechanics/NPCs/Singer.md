| [[1-Session Journals/05-25-2025\|05-25-2025]] | The party, consisting of [[Dáelen Ashforge\|Dáelen Ashforge]], [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], arrived at the city gates of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. They were accompanied by [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], who were recognized by the guards and allowed entry. Once inside, [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] departed on their own errands, with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] splitting off from [[Dabadu\|Dabadu]]. A city guard approached the party, questioning their loitering. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asserted he was from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], leading to a tense exchange. The party inquired about selling a sword, and the guard directed them towards the blacksmith or the grand fountain in the city courtyard as potential meeting spots for buyers. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also asked about an artifact shop, and the guard, with some reluctance, pointed them towards "[[Drobber's Drobbins\|Drobber's Drobbins]]."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party went outside to find a cart. A stable dude informed them the carts were not for sale or rent. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] attempted to claim one by pretending to be the supposed owner, but the stable dude wasn't fooled. The real owner, an old man with a tuft of hair named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], appeared. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then tried to persuade [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] to allow them use of his transportation to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], since he lived there. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] also attempted to persuade him, suggesting he could do mobile sales. After a successful persuasion check from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (19), [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] agreed to let them use his cart, which would be driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, including [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]], boarded [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s cart, driven by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]], the cart's owner, made small talk, asking what brought them to the guild. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] vaguely mentioned a deal gone sideways. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] mentioned he knew [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Jason Dingle\|Jason Dingle]] ("Dangle") for ten years. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] asked if [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] knew a quick way back from [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] or if they could borrow his cart. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] initially refused to lend the cart. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] had [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] try to charm him, but [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] claimed to dislike dogs, calling [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] "stinky." As he sniffed [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]], he noticed something approaching in the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The battle began with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] landing a surprise punch on the lead bandit. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]], utilizing Sharpshooter, quickly eliminated an enemy archer with a precise headshot. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Sable\|Sable]] also engaged the bandit leader. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] focused on other melee attackers, with [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]]'s Green Flame Blade arcing to a second foe. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then invoked Giant's Might, growing in size and unleashing a flurry of devastating attacks with his greatsword, felling several bandits in quick succession, including the one [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] and [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] had engaged. The cart driver, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], unexpectedly joined the fray, grabbing a sledgehammer and attacking the already wounded bandit captain. Despite some healing from [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took several hits from the remaining bandits, including a nasty critical from the captain. However, the party's combined offense began to turn the tide. Archers exchanged fire, and tragically, the party's horse was shot and killed. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] continued to pick off distant foes with his bow, including one particularly gruesome eyeball shot. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]], using his monk speed, dashed to intercept a fleeing bandit, knocking him prone with a blast of flame. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]], a towering figure, continued his rampage, crushing one bandit's skull underfoot as he moved to engage others. He used an Action Surge to chain together more attacks, cleaving through the remaining bandits. The last few attempted to flee or fight, but were quickly dispatched by the party, with [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] finishing the final bandit by throwing his greatsword like a javelin. He then returned to his normal size. |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the bandit captain's blood-soaked studded leather helmet as a souvenir. The party searched the bodies. They found 70 gold pieces, seven gems (two eye agate, three lapis lazuli, two malachite), one potion of healing, eleven scimitars, eleven light crossbows, one rapier, forty crossbow bolts, one set of thieves' tools, and a small keg of pork from the bandits' nearby camp. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] took the gems and one scimitar. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] took the potion of healing and the helmet. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] took the rapier and the thieves' tools. The party decided to burn the bodies and disregarded items in a bonfire off the trail, with [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] handling the pyrotechnics. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] emerged from the cart, distressed about his dead horse (named Friday). [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], now out of a job as the cart driver, also expressed concern. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] initially argued they saved [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]]'s life, but [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] offered to pay 50 gold (25 each to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Dabadoo\|Dabadoo]] and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]]) out of pocket for the trouble, which [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] contributed to. The payment was accepted, and [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]] decided to accompany them, slinging his sledgehammer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | The party, along with [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Singer\|Singer]], began the remaining hour-long walk to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], taking the main path. They arrived at the gates of the city without further incident. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] confirmed with the DM that the city was still called [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], implying the [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]] bloodline still ruled.
