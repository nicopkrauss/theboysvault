# Tim Apple
## Profile
[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]] is a 62-year-old dwarven shopkeeper who runs a cozy antique store in the capital of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. His shop, **Atavistan Artifacts**, is tucked between a bakery and a tailor in the outer market district, and it’s the kind of place you could pass a hundred times without noticing—unless you’re the sort of person who’s meant to find it.

Charming and eccentric, Apple is known for treating every customer like an old friend and every object like a treasure. His inventory ranges from polished coins and faded maps to odd devices that hum faintly with magic.

> [!attention]+ Shardbinder connection
> Tim Apple is the leader of [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]

> [!attention]+ True Identity

| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelian\|Dáelian]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                 |
