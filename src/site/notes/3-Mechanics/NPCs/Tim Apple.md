# Tim Apple
## Profile
[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]] is a 62-year-old dwarven shopkeeper who runs a cozy antique store in the capital of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. His shop, **Atavistan Artifacts**, is tucked between a bakery and a tailor in the outer market district, and it’s the kind of place you could pass a hundred times without noticing—unless you’re the sort of person who’s meant to find it.

Charming and eccentric, Apple is known for treating every customer like an old friend and every object like a treasure. His inventory ranges from polished coins and faded maps to odd devices that hum faintly with magic.

> [!attention]+ Shardbinder connection
> Tim Apple is the leader of [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]

> [!attention]+ True Identity
> Tim Apple is actually the ancient god [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]
