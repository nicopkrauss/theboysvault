# Tim Apple
## Profile
[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]] is a 62-year-old dwarven shopkeeper who runs a cozy antique store in the capital of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. His shop, **Atavistan Artifacts**, is tucked between a bakery and a tailor in the outer market district, and it’s the kind of place you could pass a hundred times without noticing—unless you’re the sort of person who’s meant to find it.

Charming and eccentric, Apple is known for treating every customer like an old friend and every object like a treasure. His inventory ranges from polished coins and faded maps to odd devices that hum faintly with magic.

> [!attention]+ Shardbinder connection
> Tim Apple is the leader of [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]

> [!attention]+ True Identity
> Tim Apple is actually the ancient god [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]

| [[1-Session Journals/Session 0\|Session 0]]   | In session zero, the group discussed the campaign's structure, starting in the wealthy region of [[2-World/Cirano/Cirano\|Cirano]] ruled by [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/King Alondus Atavistos\|King Alondus Atavistos]]. Characters were introduced, including Jared's druid, Harke's wood elf ranger, Mar's fire genasi monk, Dáelian's Shadar-Kai rune knight, and Cat's warlock. The players were tasked with collecting powerful artifacts for [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who contacted them for help in his antique shop in [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], promising wealth and power in return. House rules were established, including crit mechanics and potion usage, while players were encouraged to develop their character backgrounds before the next session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [[1-Session Journals/05-11-2025\|05-11-2025]] | [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] jokingly suggested finding and killing a baby [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] inquired about the distance to [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]], the capital, which the DM stated was a three-hour journey. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then approached a "fat drunk dude" in the guild hall to ask for transport. The man, after some confusing dialogue about carts being parked outside because they didn't fit inside the room, eventually made it clear the carts were simply outside the building. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] confirmed finding carts outside. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] then feigned having forgotten where he parked his own cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[1-Session Journals/05-04-2025\|05-04-2025]] | [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shoots at the prone [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with disadvantage but misses. Sable attempts a bite attack but misses due to [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]]'s AC. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] attacks with his longsword but misses, then hits with a bonus action unarmed strike for 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moves the Moonbeam over [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], who passes the save but still takes 10 damage. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]]'s turtle hits [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] with Produce Flame for 1 damage. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] casts Eldritch Blast but misses. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], head still in lava, takes 15 damage (lava + Moonbeam). He levitates out of the lava, gets up, and channels the full power of all the artifacts. He snaps his fingers, and shadowy tendrils erupt, enveloping and immobilizing everyone, including covering their mouths. He transforms back into the old man, [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], who appears heavily injured. He states he was always going to get the artifacts. After a brief, muffled exchange, he covers [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]]'s mouth again. He then dissolves all the artifacts off the party members, the liquid magic flowing into his hands. He performs a symbol and says, "Tata for now," disappearing in a puff of smoke.                                                 |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | With the cultist gone, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] used Detect Magic, revealing the cloak and the strange second key [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] found were magical. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] investigated a table the cultist had been near and found a journal detailing the cultist's long vigil. The journal mentioned an incantation placed on the cloak that would trigger a fiery explosion if anyone got within 20 feet. The party backed away. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] threw a rock, which did nothing. [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] shot an arrow through the circle, also triggering nothing. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] sent his turtle familiar (immune to fire) to retrieve the cloak. As the turtle touched it, a fiery trap exploded, but the turtle was unharmed. The trap was sprung, but the cloak remained floating, too heavy for the turtle. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] then walked up and retrieved Recto's Cloak, a powerful magical item. A quick inventory confirmed each party member now possessed one artifact: [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] (Crown), [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] (Boots), [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] (Cloak), [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] (Gloves), [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] (Chestpiece), [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]] (Bow). The party decided against a short rest to attune the new cloak, wanting to make Tim Apple's deadline.                                                     |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The fight continued. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] killed another bandit with a massive leap and teleport combo, then charmed the last remaining bandit using his Stone Rune reaction. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] moved his Moonbeam to cover the reinforcements. [[1-Party/Seraphina\|Seraphina]] attempted Green-Flame Blade but missed. [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]] killed one reinforcement. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] stripped the unconscious captain of weapons. The remaining bandits were quickly dispatched by Moonbeam damage, [[1-Party/Harke\|Harke]]'s arrows, and [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]'s attacks. [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] executed his charmed bandit "best friend". With the combat over, the party looted the bodies, finding gold and weapons, including an ornately decorated longsword taken by [[1-Party/Mar\|Mar]]. [[1-Party/Zorro\|Zorro]] stabilized the dying captain by cauterizing his wounds. Under interrogation (aided by intimidation and threats), the captain revealed Tim Apple had sent them with orders to kill the party on sight and take the relics. He produced a note confirming this. [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] knocked the captain out, killing him.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-26-2025\|04-26-2025]] | The party debated how to approach [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]], deciding to take the cart back but feigning ignorance about his betrayal. They returned to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]] (now 2 PM) and found the disgruntled carriage driver. After some haggling and intimidation, they paid him part of the fee (25 gold) plus a bonus (15 gold) to take the "scenic route," allowing them a long rest during the 8-hour journey. During the ride, they learned from the driver that Tim Apple was feared, had branded the driver for interrupting him (with the Shardbinder symbol), and that others had been transported to the area recently (including the bandits they just fought). The driver dropped them off not in the city, but at a ruined blacksmiths' guild outside it, where Tim Apple was waiting. Tim led them inside, recounting the guild's history, before descending stairs into a vast chamber below. There, Tim revealed his true form – [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]], a Shardbinder who survived the "god's death" – and demanded the artifacts. The party refused. [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Gul'Roth\|Gul'Roth]] began drawing power from the relics, the room shook, and Shardbinder reinforcements appeared as initiative was rolled for the final confrontation. |
| [[1-Session Journals/04-06-2025\|04-06-2025]] | The party gathers outside [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Tim Apple\|Tim Apple]]’s artifact shop in the port city of [[2-World/Cirano/Atavista/Atavista\|Atavista]]. Tim tasks them with retrieving six artifacts from the [[1-Party/Dáelen\|Dáelen]] linked to the secretive cult known as [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/The Shardbinders\|The Shardbinders]]. He offers that if the party can collect the artifacts and return to him in 2 days, he'll let them keep half of what they find. He provides [[3-Mechanics/Items/Tim's Compass\|Tim's Compass]] a magical bronze compass that emits mist pointing toward the artifacts and one-way carriage tickets to [[2-World/Cirano/Taverske\|Taverske]], a military outpost near the mountains. The group reluctantly agrees, though tensions rise between [[1-Party/Braegrom\|Braegrom]] and the elves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
