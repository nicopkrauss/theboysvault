# Forged in Fire
They called him Eskaro the Unyielding—Titan of Earth. It was his shard that gave the mountain its breath again. Three hammer blows began the forging, struck in silence beneath the world. The smith did not speak. The forge did not roar. And still, the stone came alive.

The shard was pried from a buried relic unearthed at the edge of the Faaltan Mountains. Giantsteel was folded into volcanic stone, veined with rivulets of molten essence. The shard merged with a magma gem at its heart and did not dim even as it was bound, instead pulsing brighter with every strike, as though it remembered the tremors of the titan’s last breath.

The Bulwark was completed in the [[2-World/Cirano/Faaltan Mountains/Heartforge\|Heartforge]] on the twenty-third day of the third month, in the thirty-seventh year AG. It was not built to defend. It was built to _endure_—and to make others yield.
