# On Shardbinder Origins
We are not seekers of chaos, as the outer world believes. We are stewards of what was, and architects of what must be.

I record these words not for the unbelieving, but for those who have already stepped into silence—who feel the shard beneath their skin and the weight of purpose settle into the marrow. If you are reading this, you have already been Called. What remains now is understanding.

### On Our Origin

Long before the Age of Man, before kings, before gods were driven from their thrones, there were six. The Primal Titans, whose hearts governed the flame, the stone, the breath, the dark, the bloom, and the grave. They shaped the world, not with will, but with presence.

And one among them—Faal, the Unrelenting—saw what the others did not: that stasis is failure. That divinity unused is divinity wasted. So he reached within and tore from each their crystalline heart, and in so doing, shattered the false perfection of the world.

The backlash consumed him. The world changed. And from the crystalized remains of the titans’ essence, the Shards were born.

We are his shadow, and his refinement.

### The Three Purposes

All who serve the Founder must know the words with which our revolution began. These are not commands, but words we live by:

> **For the defense of sacred knowledge.**  
> **For the glory of the Founder.**  
> **For the power to mold the world.**

They are not interchangeable. They are not metaphor. They are the lens through which we see all action.

Speak the wrong purpose, and the mountain will remind you that truth is sharp.

We do not apologize for what the world calls theft, nor for the blood we spill in pursuit of reunion. The broken world cannot be mended without fracture. We are not the threat. We are the scalpel.
