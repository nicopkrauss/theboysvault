# Relics of Power
Most who seek power from the ancient titans pursue shards—crystalized fragments of the titanic hearts torn apart in the final age. These shards, when bound to mortal objects, create artifacts of immense potency: weapons that strike truer, armor that resists even time, tools that hum with a primal thrum. But each shard is only a sliver of a greater whole, carrying but a whisper of the titan’s original power.

A fully fused heart, however, is something else entirely. When enough shards are brought together and reforged in perfect resonance, they awaken as a complete relic—a singular core echoing with the undiluted essence of its titan. These relics are not merely tools; they are world-shaping forces. To hold one is not to wield power, but to become its vessel. Only one such heart is believed to have been completed since the fall of the titans—and with it, all gods were killed, and an age ended.
