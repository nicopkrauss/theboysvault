The **Gathering** is the most significant event in recorded history. It marks the end of the Age of Divinity and the beginning of the current era—the **Age of Man**. All years are now counted from this moment, designated **After Gathering (AG)**. The current year is **842 AG**.

## What Happened

During the final years of the divine age, a legendary figure named [[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Silvanaar\|Silvanaar]] succeeded in gathering together a series of powerful relics—shards believed to be fragments of the heart of the [[Titan of Death, Faal\|Titan of Death, Faal]]. When combined, these shards formed a weapon of unimaginable power: the mythical [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Godrender\|Godrender]].

Wielding [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Godrender\|Godrender]], Silvanaar challenged the gods themselves. One by one, the divine were struck down, not merely killed, but erased—unmade in a way that ended their influence entirely. The skies cracked. The stars shifted. Mortal kingdoms trembled.

When the last god fell, the Age of Divinity ended.

## Aftermath

Silvanaar disappeared in the wake of the Gathering, along with [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Godrender\|Godrender]]. No one knows where they went, whether they survived, or what happened to the weapon. Their legacy endures in the world left behind—one without gods, without miracles, and governed entirely by mortals.

Though countless scholars, cults, and rulers have searched for [[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Godrender\|Godrender]], none have found it. It remains one of the greatest mysteries of the modern age, and the defining legend of the last era.

> [!attention]+ Survivors of the Gathering
> Gul’Roth, god of transformation and ambition, was the only deity to survive the Gathering. He escaped death by anchoring his divine essence to the **[[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Ring of Becoming\|Ring of Becoming]]**, a relic forged from the heart of the [[Titan of Darkness Filandir\|Titan of Darkness Filandir]].

> [!attention]+ Silvanaar's story
> After the Gathering, **[[3-Mechanics/NPCs/Silvanaar\|Silvanaar]]** vanished along with Godrender. While the world believes them both lost, Silvanaar will return in a years time.
