# The Rootless Branch
They say the bow was not carved, but revealed—drawn from a branch that had never known earth. It grew atop a sheer cliff on the eastern rim of the Faaltan Rise, lashed by wind, fed only by mist. No tool could touch it until the shard called to it.

The shard of Titan of Wind, Lathaya, was found surrounded by branches floating above the dirt. The rootless branch, it vanished within the grain—and the wood began to sing. The artisan wore no armor and carried no flame. Only silence, and a knife of bone.

[[3-Mechanics/Items/Titan Artifacts/Lathaya's Bow\|Lathaya's Bow]] was strung beneath a sky with no clouds on the second day of the fourth month, in the one-hundred-thirty-fifth year AG. The ivy that wraps it has never wilted, and never will.
