# Titans as We Know Them
## The Primal Titans of Ambrel
Long before the rise of mortals, before kingdoms carved the land or gods carved the sky, there were the Titans. Eight primordial beings, each born of a force that existed before thought, before form. They did not build. They did not speak. They simply were. Their conflicts were creation. Their deaths, devastation. It is said that one among them—Faal—sought dominion over the rest and in his treachery unraveled the world. The echoes of their struggle remain in the bones of the earth, the breath of the storm, and the silence between stars. Though their bodies are dust, the memory of the Titans endures.

### Viremyr – Titan of Flame

Viremyr was the embodiment of fire in its purest form: not merely destruction, but transformation. He danced across the world in waves of searing heat, reducing forests to ash and forging deserts from fertile plains. But from the ruin he left behind, life would always crawl back stronger. Flame to him was never a weapon—it was a cycle. His presence was felt in volcanic eruptions, in the crackle of lightning-born wildfires, and in the hearts of those who burned too bright for the world around them.

**TLDR:** Viremyr is flame—destructive, cleansing, and reborn through ruin.

### Gynara – Titan of Nature

Gynara was the force of unchecked growth, a living storm of roots and tooth and bloom. Where she walked, the land erupted with wild growth—jungles swallowed valleys, vines tore down stone. She cared nothing for balance. To her, life was a devouring thing, beautiful and relentless. She gave rise to predator and prey alike and vanished into the deep wood, never to be seen in the same form twice. Some say the animals still remember her.

**TLDR:** Gynara is nature—endless, hungry, and everchanging.

### Lathaya – Titan of Wind

Lathaya moved faster than thought, shaping the world in whispers and gales. She was freedom made manifest: invisible, untouchable, wild. Sailors called to her in storm and calm alike, though none could hold her. Her voice stirred leaves and tore down towers, and her passage could lift kingdoms or scatter armies. She never lingered, never chose a side—she simply moved.

**TLDR:** Lathaya is wind—unseen, unpredictable, and always moving.

### Rekto – Titan of War

Rekto was the clash of armies, the silence before a charge, and the scream of steel on steel. He existed only for conflict. His armor was hammered from fallen mountains, his limbs soaked in the blood of countless forgotten creatures. He never slept, never ceased. War was not a means to an end—it was the end, and he was its champion. No treaties could bind him. No peace could hold.

**TLDR:** Rekto is war—eternal, brutal, and without reason.

### Eskaro – Titan of Earth

Eskaro did not move for centuries at a time. His patience was geologic, his silence deeper than caverns. He was the strength beneath all things, the bedrock of existence. When he stirred, mountains crumbled. When he stood, oceans shifted. To those who could wait long enough to listen, he was wisdom. To all others, he was a wall that would not break.

**TLDR:** Eskaro is earth—immovable, ancient, and vast.

### Filandir – Titan of Darkness

Filandir was not shadow but the absence of all things—sight, sound, truth. He walked unseen, spoke without voice, and sowed doubt like seed. Where he passed, memory faltered and names were forgotten. He did not destroy with force, but with erasure. Entire histories vanished in his wake. Some believe he never left, only hid behind all things, watching.

**TLDR:** Filandir is darkness—erasure, silence, and hidden truths.

---

### Faal – Titan of Death

Faal coveted what he could not create. In envy, he tore the hearts from his siblings, hoping to bind their powers to his will. He failed. The act unraveled his body and mind, breaking the world alongside him. Yet death, once born, could not be undone. It passed into all things—into rot, into silence, into endings. Faal's ambition doomed them all, but gave the world its final law: nothing lives forever.

**TLDR:** Faal is death—betrayal, hunger, and the end of all things.

---

### Caelindir – Titan of Illusion

Caelindir was never one thing. He wore a thousand faces and spoke in riddles that unraveled as truth. He existed between moments—half seen, half believed. To know Caelindir was to doubt yourself. His illusions weren’t tricks—they were alternate realities, layered so thick even the other titans began to forget what was real. Some say Caelindir never died, only changed shape so convincingly that not even he remembers his true form.

**TLDR:** Caelindir is illusion—truth twisted, reality blurred, and identity lost.
